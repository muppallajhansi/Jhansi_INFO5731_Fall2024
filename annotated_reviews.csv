1,"It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.",positive
2,"If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.",positive
3,"First off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.",positive
4,"This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.",positive
5,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.",positive
6,"I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.",positive
7,"It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away.Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!",positive
8,"Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.",neutral
9,"I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists. The humor throughout the film is spot-on, providing moments of levity without undermining the emotional depth of the narrative.Just go and see it!",positive
10,"I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!",positive
11,"The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie.",positive
12,"It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.",positive
13,"It was the best, Probably the best animation i saw in my entire life.The art style was amazing, Sound design was perfect and even the storyline was too good!I hope the part 2 will release sooner!At my oponion, it was best spider man movie, You need to see this.Storyline was a kinda teenager type and was so goodI'll hope to see part 2
It was the best, Probably the best animation i saw in my entire life.The art style was amazing, Sound design was perfect and even the storyline was too good!Sony did great in this show, It will be in my memory for years, That was great for someone like me.",positive
14,"LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part
-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting
-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling
-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree
-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs
-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes
-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style
-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced
-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets
-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me
-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters
-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:
Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5.",positive
15,"The first movie was great; original, funny, interesting, diverse. This movie is like you when say you like a song, so they play the same song twice as loud hoping you love it twice as much. It more disjointed, the emotions get lost, and really, the ending? In 2 hours and 16 minutes you can bring this movie to at least a temporary conclusion? The villain does not have a good enough back story to carry one, much less two movies. That said some of the spiderverses we see were very creative (especially India-Manhattan mix), and the lead character is as always very likeable. It's like they really didn't much else to say, and then they take too long to say what they did.",positive
16,"I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.",positive
17,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.",positive
18,"I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.",positive
19,"The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.",neutral
20,It was absolutely awesome. I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .,positive
21,"Is the best movie of the decade an over exaggeration for this movie? To put it simply, no. Everything about this film is perfect.... well, other than the stupid cliff hanger ending. But i've learn to accept it overtime. Anyway the animation is spectacular. It has so many little details that you've 100% missed. The story is also amazing. The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy. Speaking of spider-punk he's definetly my fav character. I hope he gets more screen time in the 3rd installation, beyond the spider-verse. Anyways this movie is perfect and I really look foward for the final installation for this series.",positive
22,"I said it and I don't feel sorry about it! I'm not a comic book lover but I am a bit of a nerd. I really enjoyed the first movie and it's aesthetic. This movie is better! Better I tell you! The story is well done... the visuals are mesmerizing... the score just clicks with the visual and story like Lego. I wanted more! I craved more! I was angry then it ended, because it ended. This these movies define what a comic book movie should be like. It makes the MCU seem like a dumpster of hot garbage. So well done!! Easily one of the best movies of the last 5 years.... Do yourself a favor... go see it. Do a friend a favor and take them with you.",positive
23,"This is whiteout a doubt peak Spider-Man and even peak cinema!Every scene in this animation movie was as good as perfect! The coloring, animation, character designs, music and the way they used the Spider humor was so funny and well timed!Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is...
It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!There are so many Easter eggs & Spider-man's it to crazy for words!What more can i say than this is a masterpiece and probably the best Spider-Man movie to date!",positive
24,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only builds upon the brilliance of its predecessor but takes the scope of it to a whole new level. The film plunges audiences into an exhilarating journey across dimensions, where familiar characters and new faces collide in a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.One of the standout aspects of this film is its ability to strike a delicate balance between paying homage to the original while expanding its universe in unexpected ways. The first movie introduced us to the groundbreaking animation style, capturing our hearts with its heartfelt storytelling and dynamic characters. Across the Spider-Verse, however, elevates the stakes and explores uncharted territories, pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in this genre of movies as a whole.The animation remains a work of art, with each frame bursting with energy, inventiveness, and meticulous attention to detail. From the kaleidoscopic visuals that bring the various universes to life, to the fluid and dynamic action sequences that leave us breathless, every moment is a testament to the creativity and talent of the filmmakers.Moreover, Across the Spider-Verse delves deeper into the characters we fell in love with in the first film, allowing them to evolve and face new challenges. The emotional depth and growth of the characters resonate with audiences on a profound level, making us cheer for their triumphs and empathize with their struggles. The film strikes a perfect balance between heartwarming moments, thrilling action, and thought-provoking themes, making it a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. However, audiences should go into this knowing that it's definitely a 'Part 1' of a larger narrative in every sense.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse cements its place not only as a worthy successor to its predecessor but as a groundbreaking and unforgettable film in its own right. It expands the Spider-Verse in ways we couldn't have imagined, immersing us in a world of boundless imagination and emotional resonance. With its breathtaking animation, complex characters, and masterful storytelling, it stands as a testament to the power and potential of animated films, leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment in this extraordinary franchise.Choosing between the two is like choosing between your kids - the first is a tighter story but this movie is far more expansive and blows the scope of the movie into the stratosphere taking risks along the way. They're equally perfect in different ways.",neutral
25,"I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.",positive
26,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel to the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The film is plagued by pacing issues, a reliance on clichés, and a lack of focus.The film's biggest problem is its length. At two hours and twenty minutes, it feels like two movies crammed into one. The first half of the film is slow and meandering, with too many subplots that don't really go anywhere. The second half of the film is much better, but it still feels rushed.Another issue with the film is its reliance on clichés. The theme of family is particularly overused, and it doesn't really add anything new to the story. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, with some scenes feeling too long and others feeling too short.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessor.",neutral
27,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which was released in 2018. It offers audiences another Spider-Verse experience with its innovative animation style and thrilling story.The film continues to focus on the story of Miles Morales. Miles returns as the unique Spider-Man we met in the previous film, and this time, he teams up with Gwen Stacy/Spider-Gwen and encounters various Spider-Man heroes. Together, they embark on an adventure, traveling through multiple dimensions and presenting viewers with a much broader Spider-Verse world.The film retains some of the successful aspects from the first installment. First and foremost, it offers visually stunning animation. The vibrant and energetic scenes, along with striking character designs and detailed backgrounds, captivate the audience. The creative use of animation enhances the liveliness of the story and characters.In terms of the story, Across the Spider-Verse introduces a new and intriguing approach by utilizing the concept of multiple universes. The interactions between different Spider-Man versions add depth to the story and take the audience on a journey filled with surprises. It also focuses on character development and explores the internal conflicts of Miles Morales' superhero journey.The film's greatest strength, just like its predecessor, lies in its sense of humor. The comedic elements are cleverly and entertainingly used, appealing to all age groups. The humor helps balance the story and provides viewers with an enjoyable experience.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offers an exciting experience for fans of the first film. With its creative animation, compelling story, and impressive characters, this sequel further deepens the Spider-Verse universe. It is a must-watch for fans of the series.",positive
28,"As visually stunning and groundbreaking of the animation, unfortunately, it was too much to take. I'm in my early 40s so younger viewers probably won't be affected as much. Didn't have an issue with Into the Spider-verse, but apparently, they increased the intensity to the point that I left with a headache. The different frame rates of characters in the same scene, the visual distortion in the background at times, made it difficult to focus and was basically visual overstimulation. I enjoyed the story and would like to see Beyond the Spider-verse but may have to just read about it if the animation is as intense as this film.",positive
29,"I absolutely loved the previous movie Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, it became my favourite animation to date by far. The storyline, animation and soundtrack is amazing! 10/10...But I lost interest in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse within 30mins. The storyline felt boring, repetitive and scatty. The cramming in of as many teen and family cliches as possible (in order to make it relatable no doubt) felt very forced and unnatural. It made it more of a teen movie, rather than for all the family like the last one. There is also a sense that the Diversity Equity Inclusion 'committee' strongly informed the story and characters, which again came across as forced, which left me wondering was their top priority writing a great story, or was it to meet certain DEI quotas.Anyway this film does not compare to the previous and I have no idea why it's scored so highly, one film is an absolute masterpiece, the other is a giant action-packed cliche.",positive
30,"Just watched the movie yesterday (and rewind the last 30 minutes or so several times!).Very few times in multiple film industry's history, the sequel surpassed its predecessors. ""Into the spider-verse"" put itself in such height with every possible parameters like story-line, character buildup, animation style etc and of course the music!Before watching ""across the spider-verse"", I was confident that, this one will at most come close to the first one, AT MOST...
But boy, was I wrong!! Without leaking any (probably!) spoilers, I'll say just this one thing. I watched about 4/5k movies plus TV shows at least. And I never gladly accepted a show/ movie which ended with a cliffhanger, actually hated them. But this one will remain the SINGULAR exception. And I'll be eagerly waiting for ""beyond the spider-verse"".And the last two songs (self love and am I dreaming) hit really hard, specially after watching the movie at one go. Been listening these two songs the whole day (before, after and even during the office time!)",neutral
31,"I was really blown away by this masterpiece. It's beautiful, clever, funny and deep. And it dares being a comics in each and every frame. It never allows you to forget these are drawn characters you see. Unlike so many animated movies of recent time it doesn't go for the smooth polished look it makes certain we never forget that we watch a comics book that was brought to life on screen. Just like Rembrandt made sure we all see his brush strokes when we watch his paintings. But just like Rembrandt, it's done without allowing the technical mastery of it all to drop one little bit. But it's way more than simple issue of the looks of it. This is comics all the way, thematically as well as visually, hence the ending we got.They didn't give up on anything; didn't allow a single detail to go amiss. They wouldn't give up on any bit of storytelling. It's all there, no matter how long the final cut will be, and still, it's not too long not even a second too long. The characters are all fully developed - real human beings drawn in comics form, but human just like any of us watching them on screen. It calls for some of the best voice acing I've seen, by each and every member of the cast. I simply can't single out anyone of them. They were all superb.And than the story itself - It's way more than just sci-fi comics. It doesn't limit itself to the usual issues of power and its moral implications. It's asking us the deep questions of what determines the path our life take? Are we ruled by our destiny? Is it all written in our stars? If I had a problem with most of the comics I read it was because of the fatalistic approach adopted by most of them. This one defies the tradition in the best way. It breaks down all the accepted rules and leaves us all hanging in one of the best cliff hangers ever.If you love comics, science fiction, action movies or simply real brilliant cinema - go see it.",positive
32,"Spider-man was a a visually transcendent cinematic experienceThat movie just did some incredible things for animation & story telling. It's ability to craft a physically, visual web of representation of all of the marvel universe, what it is and can be.And to top it off I bought the only ticket in the center of the IMAX movie theater. And I went Alone, because theres nothing wrong with carving our own path.. just like this movie... seriously if i could give a standing ovation without being literally the only dummy standing in the room. I would!Take mind: i was microdosing mushrooms, nonetheless im sure the majority of people would agree10/10.",neutral
33,"There are rarely movies that are better then the prequel - this movie is one of them. The amount of detail in the movie and the angles are ridiculously good. I really loved how gwen and miles' stories were expanded upon, and how many new characters were introduced - especially the scientist that got hit with a bagel in the previous movie. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to view the screening of the movie, and that was the highlight of my day, keeping me on the seat waiting for the next big event. The only part I disliked was probably the ginormous cliff hanger at the end - since now I have to wait till next march to view the final movie.I CANNOT wait until the third one is released, and the day it gets released - will be going to the theater to watch it.",positive
34,"I can't even describe how much fun this movie was! The animation, the voiceover, the music (OHH, THE MUSIC). It was a complete surreal experience. Every frame of the movie looks so beautiful. The way that it has been stylized makes it so pleasing to your eyes. The story has different aspects running simultaneously that will keep you engaged till the very end and will leave you wanting for more. I'm pretty sure they're gonna make a third one and I simply can't wait for it. Don't miss this one in the theatres. It's one of a kind experience that needs to be enjoyed on the big screen. Alright, until next time! Peace!",positive
35,"The movie did a great job in the first part and I really enjoyed it so personally I am especially looking forward to the second part and after watching the movie it exceeded my expectations.I love how the film expands its scope and adds more stories to the characters, specifically Gwen (Gwanda), in the new cast I'm super impressed with Oscar Isaac as the voice of Miguel O 'hara , he's been through enough pain to make himself responsible for protecting Spider-Verse and believing himself to be right no matter what . Speaking of Miles, he's really matured in this part, he's just a 15 year old kid who has to balance his Spider-man lifestyle with himself, I like the way Miles tackles problems differently from the rest of Spider-Man . The movie is really fan service, making viewers satisfied with every detail, graphics and family story of Spider-Man.I love every moment of this movie and am looking forward to the sequel, hopefully more Miles and Spider-Verse movies will come out.",positive
36,"Its not bad, it just doesn't fill the shoes.The movie is caught up in doing a bad impression of the original but misses the small details and cleverness that made the original a hit.So much of the plot and dialog is flat. The surprises didn't surprise me. I barely noticed them. The jokes where uninspired. I think I laughed once. The stakes where much higher but the tension felt much lower.Its worse in the technical aspects as well. Sound design, Pacing, Art Direction, Character Depth and Development all worse. Technically Across the Spider-Verse has a deeper world but not much of it was not memorable. I felt like the movie took a long time to say and show very little where the original did the complete opposite.When the squeal was announced and I heard they had different directors I raised an eyebrow. I lightly considered that team to be miracle workers. Unfortunately the concerns seem proven. The current Directing team says they're done after the second act of Across the Spider-Verse.I know a colossal amount of time, energy and love went into this movie and I'm scorching it. Squeals are notoriously hard to balance. They are often caught between what the original was and what so many people imagine that it should have/ could have been. Squeals sometimes they get tangled trying to be an unnecessary correction.Despite all these criticisms its still a good movie. There was a lot to appreciate. It was fun and characters will make you feel something. The best parts of the movie where all around the Parents of the many Spider-Verses. They tried to make the importance of family the core but that is difficult in an action movie were the hero's are living split secrete lives. Holding out hope for the next one.",positive
37,"People who are saying that they can't like this movie because it ends in a cliffhanger are silly. Plenty of books and pieces of media that are objectively and subjectively enjoyable end with cliffhangers. It's interesting because some of the people who complain about this film ending the way it did also are giving praise to Empire Strikes Back- a movie that ended in a cliffhanger. There doesn't need to be conclusion to a film to enjoy it and have fun. There's a lot of character growth, a good story, a lot of interesting ideas and the art direction is beautiful and revolutionary. There's plenty in this film to satisfy movie goers and fans alike.",positive
38,"Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD.",positive
39,"The film made me so upset because there was no epilepsy or flashing lights warning, horrid sound mixing, and overall so flashy it just wasn't fun. I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.It honestly felt expensive, but overall just lazy.Really disappointed.",negative
40,"This movie is the proof that marvel is still alive, all is perfect.The writing, the story, the soundtrack, all the characters and everything else is just amazing.Gwen is one of the best written character i have ever seen in a superhero movie.Antagonists are really well done and putting three antagonists in a single film is something else.If there's a film that a person must see in his life is this, i swear that's top 5 marvel for sure and one of the best films i've ever seen.I hope y'all will see it because is just amazing i can't even explain how much this is good with my own words.AMAZING.",positive
41,"This Is My Best Cinema Experience Since Avengers Infinity War.To Scorsese, You Need To Watch This Movie. I Guarantee You That You Won't Regret It. Not Every Comic Book Movies Is A Roller Coaster Ride.Let's Talk About The Storyline For This Movie. It's So Mature & Unpredictable. I'm Glad That The Movie Managed To Keep Us Surprised For Every Moment. The Character Development Also Wonderful.Animation Also Top Notch This Time. I Think This Movie Will Be Another Benchmark To Animation Industry After This.The Music Score Is On Another Level. I Really Dig The Opening Soundtrack.Voice Acting Was Powerful. Thanks A Lot, Everyone.Overall, This Is The Best Movie That I Ever Watched In 2023 So Far .",positive
42,"As a fan of Spiderman, I really enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse because it has the best plot supported by amazing visual effects which make this movie a godsend, a masterpiece. While watching this movie, I don't even realise it is a 2 hours 16 mins movie.Good:
Firstly, extraordinary animation. It not just kept the animation style of Into the spider verse, but it also expanded what they did in the first film. They boldly adopted a variety of different visual effects of the scenes. It uses six different animation styles to portray and create new universes whereas Into the Spider-Verse only used one. I can truly say that its animation sublimates the plot of the storyline in this movie. It is worth waiting for 5 years to watch this movie!!!!! Every scene every second is extraordinary. And this movie is not skimping on providing high quality animation with charming animation styles, also putting massive easter eggs for the audiences to dig for them.Secondly, the casts perfectly adopted characters. Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld give their best performance to make their own characters more attractive and trigger my emotions to care about these characters. In my opinion, I am very obsessed with the character of Miguel O'Hara. Oscar Isaac brings an amazing performance to show Miguel O'Hara's helplessness, determination to stop Miles and insistence on doing what he thinks is right. I don't even think that he is the villain, he is just a person who doesn't want Miles to go through what he experienced before.Thirdly, the sensational plot. The movie smartly chooses to build up the background of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy instead of just putting action scenes in the first act. It is efficient step by step to build up the characteristics of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy to let the audiences know what they care for. The audiences will keep on immersing in this film while watching.Bad
If I must say the bad of this movie, I would say that the story is not completed in part 1. Some movies separated the story plot into 2 parts to let the characters gather their strength for a final confrontation in the sequel such as ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Infinite War"". For these movies, they are great because the characters have completed something and the rest of the story will be resolved in the sequel. For example, the Rebel Alliance flees from the Empire in ""Empire Strikes Back"" and Thanos successfully cuts down half of the population in the universe after he snaps his finger in ""Infinity War"". However, ""Across the spider verse"" seems like the first and second act of the story. The movie doesn't not give any answer to resolve the story and the story questions still exist until the end of this film.In conclusion, I strongly recommend you watch this movie as much as you would. And you should watch the movie with the bigger screen. Remarkable animation, amazing story plot and sensational characters build the masterpiece and it deserves you to spend the time to watch it again and again.",positive
43,"This movie is a masterpiece
The animations in this are 10/10 and each spider man/women have there own unique details especially Spider man 2099 he has had a massive upgrade from into the spider-Versestorytelling In this movie is amazing giving us the reason why miles cannot join the society and a good understanding to the multiverseThe spot is the main villain and at first he seems goofy and harmless but by the final act we see how big of a menace and a threat he is to miles and the rest of the spider societyPlot twist miles is in the wrong dimension due to the spider that bite him and he is the prowler !!??? What a way to end the movie
We need
Beyond the spider-verse.",positive
44,"Seen this in IMAXThe film itself was exceptional! A must see!I went with my brother and my 9 year old son.My 9 year old said 'oh what it's over already?' ... this kid has never sat through a full film ever.I loved the adult humor , how action packed it was and the new rock spidey had me howling!!! Its a film perfect for the kids to go see , and is fast paced! Personally can't wait for the next one to release!It's a defiantly watch again film , I came home and watched the first one again!This film didn't feel made for imax though , it did wreck the quality of viewing for me but that has no touch on how amazing the film actually was.",positive
45,"Wow just wow, the animation is outstanding. Lots of easter eggs and references to the spider man games,movies and comics. Awesome and unique characters. The action zequences are like eye candy and the fights and chases leave you on the edge of your seat. The colors are vibrant and the music is spot on. The relationships between peter b parker miles and gwen are well written. If you are a fan of the first one it's a must watch. I could go on and on about the great things but..... it ended on a cliffhanger! Before the climax! The whole theater was shocked. Guess who's going to be on the premiere next year :) definitely me.",positive
46,"Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it.",positive
47,"These people think my life is gonna be perfectly the same after watching the movie.. My life is changing for sure. It's a really good movie. The animation and the artstyle is impeccably astonishing. Similarly to the song from the first movie Sunflower, the sequel has a massive number of songs that are really great to listen to and are motivational. (To me at least). I had to wait for two hours to finally watch the movie and it was all worth it in the end. The hype that was created lived up to its name. All in all, great movie, great songs, great visuals, a lot of references and Easter eggs and it's just a great movie and go watch it right now!!!",positive
48,"I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility.",positive
49,"There is too much going on in this film. It shows in both the runtime and pacing. They were trying to go too big too fast. It should've been multiple different movies. Gwen could've had her own film based on the introduction.You don't get enough time to relate with the characters or appreciate the story beats. They just keep whipping you from one major event to another. There are also several weird plot holes as a result. It just brain my mind numb by the end.This remind me of Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. The writers wanted to squeeze a whole cinematic universe's worth of content into one movie. Some people may love the ambition, but I just don't see the masterpiece everyone else is talking about.",positive
50,"It's incredible and almost crazy how they could top the last movie. Into the spider-verse is a very good movie and is personally one of my favorite movies of all time, and it's crazy for me how they could top that movie and make it even better. The hype made me more interested and i looked even more forward to watch this movie, and my expectations for this movie were really high and i expected that this movie was going to be better than the last one, AND IT DID!The voice actors, animators, plot writers, characters and many more did an incredible work! And let's not forget Metro Boomin did an amazing work with the soundtrack. I listened to the soundtrack before i watched the movie to build up some hype, and i still listen to the soundtrack after the movie and can't stop. The animation is so smooth and satisfying to watch, i love the action packed fighting scenes and the romantic and emotional scenes. The relationship between the characters is insane. I also loved how Gwen got a bigger roll and even got her origin revealed in the beginning (i have not read the comics...). It makes her more important in the movie. And what i experienced, this movie was lightly centered around Gwen and not only Miles, which i LOVED. Gwen is certainly an interesting character. And let's not forget Hobie. An amazing guy and probably the funniest character in the movie. The Spot is a great villain. At first i thought he was not serious and felt like he was just a joke. But later in the movie it completely changed and he got way more powerful, which i loved.I really like Sam Reimi's Spider-Man because of nostalgia and that was a big part of my childhood. And the Tom Holland movies are also good, but not as good as Tobey Maguire's performance. However, the Miles Morales movies is right now, by far, my favorite movie of all time and if not the best Spider Man and superhero movies right now. And if the Beyond the Spider-verse is EVEN better than ITSV and ATSV, it'll be the best trilogy ever. No debate.For me, this movie is a 10/10, but if there is something i should ""complain"" about it's that the audio in the beginning was quite low, or maybe it were something in my cinema that was wrong. Nd the CLIFFHANGER. The ending was great and it wasn't bad to include an cliffhanger, i already knew beforehand that the movie were a part 1. But, the cliffhanger left me speechless and made me obsessed with this movie and for the last 4 days, the movie and the theories haven't left my head since.So do i recommend this movie? OH YES, go watch it! It's worth to watch in cinema, the experience will really make this movie even better. Can't wait to see the next movie!(I Apologize if my english is bad)",positive
51,"The animation blows you away, the characters are amazing and have real emotional depth and the villian was sneaky good. I can't remember the last time I've thought about a movie this much. Every scene, even if 2 characters are just speaking, is breathtaking. Most of the jokes are solid and I can't think of a dull moment in this movie. The cameos are amazing and they weren't even needed, the cameos were the icing on the cake. The multiverse is pretty hard to understand but this movie makes it very easy. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, Metro boomin was great and I cant stop listening. I really don't have any complaint about this movie, it's a masterpiece from start to finish. Please go and watch this movie.",positive
52,"I cannot explain what happened in this movie, but it is 10/10. Whenever you are watching it, just pay attention and it will make sense.Besides that, the art is phenomenal. Each and every scene looked beautiful, very vibrant colors all over. The animation is GREAT. They made all of the old spider-mans have the same old animation that they came out with, and I LOVE IT. I know EVERYONE is going crazy on the ending. The ending left everyone on the biggest cliff hanger ever.This is probably my favorite movie now, and will be for a very long time. I cannot wait for the next movie, which will reveal what happens after the cliff hanger.",positive
53,Only downside to this film is I have to wait until the next film to see what happens next. Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse checks every box. We see that Miles has grown in many ways but is still figuring out who he is. We learn more about Gwen and her background and how that connects her to Miles. I connected to their characters and related to their experiences. We also are introduced to new versions of Spiderman throughout the spider-verse and each character brings more delight.Overall the animation remains ahead of the game and is thrilling to see on the big screen. I love how the story built upon the foundation set by Into the Spider-verse without feeling boring. I honestly didn't want this film to end.,neutral
54,"The new matrix. Gives you a feeling no other movie ever will. What an amazing sequel that hits you in all the right spots. Takes so many chances and everyone works perfectly. It's so wholesome, sad, unique, stunning, and funny. It's a great setup for the next movie and if that one is nearly as good then this trilogy could be considered not just one of the best in animation but one of the best trilogies ever made period. You can take any frame of this movie and turn it into a poster. There isn't anything that I would change. It is by far the best spiderman movie and easily the best marvel movie.",positive
55,"Andrew garfield Cameo Op.My family and I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. It exceeded our expectations and proved to be even better than its predecessor. This film is an absolute must-see, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and drama that kept us engaged from start to finish. Moreover, the movie is a treasure trove of Easter eggs that added an extra layer of excitement and discovery. We wholeheartedly recommend it to all Spider-Man fans and movie enthusiasts alike.This movie is a masterpiece. Every picture has meaning. All the characters stand out and can have their stand-alone Segway. The creativity and artistic passion that went into this movie was mesmerizing. This movie deserves a second watch to discern all the meanings behind every scene. One of the best anime movies I dare say of all time. It reminds me of Hayao Miyazaki's artistic storytelling, like Spirited Away. Every scene is an adventure!",positive
56,I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time.,positive
57,"Absolute cracker of a film! Forget that it's animated, it is a film and first rate at that. The animation is out of this world, the music amazing, the story top notch and script superb. It's not often you get everything just right, but this surpasses getting it right; it's an amazing film. Even the Brit-Punk Spiderman, they got it spot on. The humour is also good and pitched at the right level, even having an apt joke about the villain talking about holes. The characters were well thought out, the dialogue was appropriate and well written. In fact, my son & I cannot criticise any of it. It's on par with the Christopher Nolan Batman films. If they could apply this level to something like DC's Injustice it would be brill. I am so glad I watched it and it's part of a 3 piece story, not just a sequel because it will make money. The story is coherent and sound and the level of research that has gone into getting it right has worked. I cannot praise it enough.",positive
58,"I loved loads about this film, mainly the amazing action sequences and the sweet sweet fan service (one bit of fan service got a big loud oooooh from myself and most of the cinema).The problem I had with it is that despite it being a 2 parter so much of the emotional exposition was stretched out far longer than necessary through overlong dialogue. About an hour of the film is dedicated to ensuring we understand that Miles is a young man finding his path through life (I have no idea how some of the younger kids in the audience sat through it, they must have just been mesmerised by the flashy colours). It could have been handled in a much more condensed manner by better writers and still had the required impact. Given the film ends at a point that feels like a natural final third act it left me feeling shortchanged.If the overlong dialogue scenes had been condensed then I believe there would have been no need for the 2 parter. But then people wouldn't pay to see 2 films instead of 1.I expect when the initial mega fan reaction dies down and more ordinary filmgoers leave shocked at the ""to be continued"" message the IMDb score will dip dramatically.",positive
59,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" currently has an astounding overall rating of 9.0. Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series.",negative
60,"Everything that was ever missing in a spiderman is precisely captured in this movie. I missed having my eyes stuck on the screen for the full runtime ! Song choices 100, the way the colours on the screen change with the change of emotions 10, animation is beyond words, the scene where Gwen confronts her dad is my favourite. Writing more would only make this review worse but since the requirement is high I don't have an option. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie is the note it ends with ! Damn my brain was on fire and my heart thumping, it reminded me of ongoing anime. Must watch !",neutral
61,"I loved it. From start to finish and the music. It's art really. It had really cool twists that I did not see coming (and I'm usually really good at calling those). It also has some great cameos and Easter eggs in it that I was excited to see. It does say ass quite a bit. Probably at least 3 or 4 times but that's it. We took our school so it was hard to hear it over the kids. Meaning the cuss words are well placed. As a mom, the speech that Mile's mom gave had me tearing up. I also think it's something that my three year old would enjoy. So it's definitely family friendly (unless you're super strict about cuss words.)",positive
62,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated superhero films. As a huge fan of the first Spider-Verse movie, my expectations were sky-high, and I am thrilled to say that this sequel not only met but exceeded them. From start to finish, it was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that left me on the edge of my seat.One of the standout aspects of this film is its animation style. The combination of traditional hand-drawn animation with cutting-edge CGI creates a unique and vibrant visual experience. The attention to detail is impeccable, with every frame bursting with color and energy. The action sequences are mind-blowing, with the characters leaping off the screen and swinging through the city with incredible fluidity. It truly feels like a comic book come to life.The story takes place after the events of the first film, and it delves deeper into the multiverse concept. Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man, embarks on a journey across different dimensions, encountering various versions of Spider-Man along the way. The narrative is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and high-stakes action, making for a well-rounded and satisfying experience.The voice acting is top-notch, with Shameik Moore reprising his role as Miles Morales. He brings a youthful energy and vulnerability to the character, making him relatable and likable. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, also deliver fantastic performances, adding depth and humor to their respective roles.What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex themes and emotions. It explores the idea of identity, the weight of responsibility, and the importance of family and friendship. These themes are handled with care and resonate on a deep level, making the characters feel more human and relatable.If I had to nitpick, there were a few moments where the pacing felt slightly rushed, and some characters could have been given more screen time. However, these minor flaws do not detract from the overall excellence of the film.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any fan of the superhero genre. It is a visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and action-packed adventure that will leave you wanting more. With its incredible animation, engaging story, and memorable characters, it deserves a solid 9 out of 10. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for the Spider-Verse franchise.",positive
63,"A breath of fresh air amidst the horror show that the MCU has devolved into. I'm not sure if it's the constant disappointment from the latest Marvel movie, but this movie was beyond incredible.Another solid storyline, fantastic VA and art work, great soundtrack, and cameos that made me very happy. The addition of Oscar Isaac and Daniel Kaluuya helps elevate the movie further, they've done such a good job. Seeing Miles' relationship with Gwen and Peter be developed further was also great, as they try to balance doing what's good for the multiverse and what's good for Miles.I can't wait to see the next instalment, this is shaping up to be one of the better trilogies in cinema.",positive
64,"If there is one downside to it, it is that you must rewatch it to see everything.And with that out of the way, just go and enjoy Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The graphics are phenomenal. Just take a sec to look at the backgrounds. The colors. The emotions. The psychology of it all.The story takes off where the previous one ended. Almost. There is some time in between. A story true to the characters. Duty, responsibility friendship, commitment, love. And you know, with great power comes great responsibility.I went in with a friend and my not-so-young kids and we all enjoyed the time. And so happy there was no break. There simply is no need for a break.Favorite movie of the year. So far.Enjoy it. At least 2 times ;-).",positive
65,"I am speechless, I don't know what i have to compliment about it, One word everything. Animation perfect, soundtrack perfect, characters perfect, design perfect, coloring perfect, plot perfect, Antagonist perfect. I was ready to set for 4 hours if it was necessary that is how great it was. This movie could lead to the best triology ever made for a superhero, comic, animated movie ever. It was mind-blowing. The spot they took a not knowen villian to make it maybe the greatest super-villian in a comic book movie. Miguel was in a beast mood all through the movie. It has the perfect development to the characters. I loved it.",positive
66,"I had decently big expectations for this one, especially for a spider man movie, but rarely any of them were filled.I don't know how people find this movie that great, i just find it an ok movie with an ok plot. I definitely saw a lot of potential, but the plot was too overwhelming with so many things in the background. Main thing that i didn't like was the lack of action. I went to watch this movie to see a great plot, and a ton of action, but that certainly didn't happen.The first 40 minutes of the movie covers just the main characters which i found pretty boring. Rest of the movie was just 20 things happening at the same time. I felt like falling asleep halfway through, but luckilt at least there was some action.Definitely an ""Avengers: infinity war"" try, but lacks action. 7/10 at most.",neutral
67,"I loved this movie. It was so well written and have just about everyone shining. It takes a complicated concept like the multiverse and actually tells it in a way anyone can understand and actually explore different types of universes.Gwen is shown struggling, vulnerable, yet still strong and confident. Miles isn't a side show in his own movie either even though we finally see Miguel take stage. They set this up for a sequel and I was honestly ready for another 2 hours when this ended.Just like the first movie, the soundtrack goes with the scenes and add to the feel. I grew up in NYC, and this really took me back. BRAVO!!",positive
68,"Across the Spider-Verse is a good film, better than the first one for sure but not something that should have 8.9 rating. I'm mixed about the animation, some things look really great but the other half is nauseating. I really didn't like the phasing, the movie is more than 2 hours long and it feels like the chase scene in the multiverse takes 1/3 of the film. The Spot is a fun villain but still don't get how he suddenly goes from wanting to rob an ATM machine to wanting to destroy the entire world, don't like how he just disappeared for the rest of the film. Miguel was fun even though his backstory was also really generic. Across the Spider-Verse is a good movie, but it relies on flashy animation and fanservice to cover up it's flaws. For example, am I the only one not ok with classic Peter Parker bringing his daughter to extremely dangerous places? Or with Spider-Woman getting slammed to a train while being pregnant? Also, too many Spider-Mans are just a parody of themselves. Don't get me started with awful modern humor. Overall, the sequel is better than the first film, but even more overrated. Flawed plot, great animation, ok soundtrack, fun action, too much fanservice.",positive
69,"Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie but people are acting like this is Godfather 2. It's rated higher than The Dark Knight lol . I'd probably put it 7th on the list of Spider-Man movies.The positive:Gwen was probably the best part of the movie. They did a great job with her and she is probably as much the lead in this movie as Miles. Her action scenes were great and her character was likable.Miles character was also very well done and it was nice to see his character progress and mature from the last one. I'm a Peter Parker guy but there is definitely room for Miles.I thought the Spot, who is usually a lame villain, was pretty cool. I liked the character arc and progression they gave him.Miguel was a decent character. I'm hoping there is more character development in Pt 2 because he just comes off like an angry jerk the entire movie.The action scenes were well done and all the cameos were a lot of fun and the final twist at the end was fantasticThe negative:It was about 45 minutes too long. I miss the sub 2 hr movie. My youngest was bored to tears before the midway point.They totally neutered Peter B Parker, who was the best part of the first movie. They made him a complete buffoon.The animation was a bit much at times. It was headache inducing.Hobart was cool when you could understand what he was saying. It was like listening to a Gallagher brother voicing a Spider-Man character..I hated every scene that Spider-Woman was in. She was easily the worst out of all the main characters in the movie.",positive
70,"This is a spoiler free review: the animation and music in this movie were outstanding! If there was one movie to watch this year, it's this one. Usually movies that have a sequel aren't the good since the first one turns out to be better. But not this one, the the second movie topped its original with flying colors. Highly recommend to anyone even if they aren't a fan of Spider-Man or Marvel. It's a fun movie for anyone to enjoy! In all honesty, the movie had me calling out every cameo/easter egg I could find since it was filled with them. And I never do that for any movie. And if there is anything I could take away from this movie, it's, ""everyone's telling me how my story is supposed to go...nah, imma do my own thing.""",positive
71,"The story at hand is truly remarkable, weaving together an intricate blend of emotions and suspense that will hold you captivated from its opening moments right through to its satisfying conclusion. Regardless of your personal preferences regarding the art style, I strongly recommend giving it a watch. I was engrossed throughout the entire film, never experiencing a single moment of boredom. The characters are well-crafted and grow in a way that adds depth to the story, making it an incredibly engaging experience. I am looking forward too see if the sequal can somehow top this absolute masterpiece.",positive
72,"GOSH! This is fantastic!I still cannot get over the Animation, beyond good! Love how it just changes with background. It just perfectly blends in with the crazy multiverse theme. It's so good and it conveys everything, the emotions, the step to seriousness and everything. Every single scene makes you to look at it with high focus in case you miss something.The artwork is fantastic. Massive step up from previously awesome ITTS.The Soundtrack man, it is up there with the very best for me. Just so so good.The Easter Eggs are all abound, which makes it more exciting.The Story and the direction they took was much lovely!",positive
73,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an absolute masterpiece that belongs in the top echelon of films. It has left an indelible mark on me, much like the original Matrix. This Marvel instalment stands out as the epitome of cinematic brilliance, captivating and spellbinding from the opening scene to the closing credits.The film's genius lies in its ability to ingeniously expand upon the groundwork laid by its predecessor, ""Into the Spider-Verse."" It seamlessly incorporates the multiverse concept, skilfully presenting it in a manner that is accessible and engrossing without overwhelming the audience. As someone who initially had reservations about the concept within the MCU, I must say that this film has erased all doubts, handling the multiverse with perfect finesse.The animation in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is nothing short of breathtaking. It effortlessly merges various art styles, resulting in a visual feast for the eyes. Every frame is meticulously crafted, showcasing a remarkable attention to detail. The vibrant colours and dynamic action sequences transport viewers into a vividly immersive comic book world that is unlike anything seen before.The characters in the film are captivating and richly developed. Miles Morales, the lead Spider-Man, continues to shine as a relatable and inspiring hero. His personal growth and journey are skilfully explored, allowing the audience to deeply empathise with his experiences. The introduction of new characters injects a fresh dose of excitement into the story, each bringing their unique personality and motivations, adding depth and complexity to the narrative.The storytelling in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is an exhilarating roller coaster ride. It masterfully blends humour, heart, and jaw-dropping action sequences to create an enthralling narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. The carefully curated soundtrack elevates the film even further, perfectly complementing the on-screen energy and eliciting the desired emotions in every scene.Whilst the film leaves certain questions unanswered, it serves as a tantalising setup for what lies ahead. It leaves viewers eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the Spider-Verse saga, craving further exploration and revelation.In summary, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an unparalleled cinematic achievement. It surpasses its predecessor in every way, delivering an awe-inspiring visual experience, compelling characters, and a masterfully crafted storyline. This film is not only a must-watch for Spider-Man enthusiasts but also a testament to the power of storytelling and groundbreaking animation. Prepare to be swept away into the mesmerising world of the Spider-Verse once again, and savour every extraordinary moment.",positive
74,"OK, this is not so original to say that this animation flick is a masterpiece. There must be several other users that say the same thing as I am saying.But the reason is simple: it's because it truly is!This movie left me overexcited for the last one of the trilogy. I felt like a little boy that had the best chocolate on the planet and was told that there will be more of it if I can wait until the next batch is ready. The animation is tip-top, the characters are deep and likeable, the story is fresh (relatively to the multi-verse mania that has been running the theaters lately), the action scenes are over the top and easy to follow, the epicness of the situation is increasing as the movie goes and many jokes are really funny (sometimes simple but they work in their simplicity because you let yourself go with the general mood of the film).Spiderman fans will have what they are looking for and newcomers will just have an insane experience of colors, beauty, action and emotions that very few movies are able to give, with a real message and deep thoughts about the multi-verse, destiny/determinism, family and responsibilities.So, dare I say it: this is the best movie of 2023 so far, the best animation movie of all time and one of the best films of all time, period. Just go watch it!",positive
75,"This movie presents us with an extremely difficult question, pushing the protagonist to choose how far he will go for the ones he loves. Everyone's motivations are understandable, the animation is somehow even better than its predecessor, and even though there was a to be continued, I see that as less of a crutch and more as an empire strikes back situation. Gwen and Mike's stories are powerful and relatable, and the new characters are awesome. One of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's hilarious that the Live Action Little Mermaid is even releasing in the same theaters as this art piece. Innovation and Storytelling at its peak.",positive
76,"Not great but it's good. They could of made this movie about 30mins shorter tbh. There's a few things I don't like about this movie. I found it sort of stupid that in a world of Spider-Man, not one Spider-Man could catch Morales. Just found it odd. You watch a whole movie to get a Clift hanger. Which wasn't that great. I felt like we were missing a big climax that never happened. I found the characters in the first movie more funny. They sort of tried too hard on this one. The cgi comic book art is cool. I find it distracting at times and it takes away from the emotions. I don't know I just had higher expectations from what reviews were saying.",positive
77,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" stands as a remarkable testament to the power of animation and storytelling, making a compelling case for its status as the greatest movie of all time. This film effortlessly weaves together multiple dimensions, bringing a fresh and visually stunning take on the beloved Spider-Man franchise.One of its strongest assets is the groundbreaking animation style that transcends conventional boundaries. It's a breathtaking kaleidoscope of artistry, blending 2D and 3D animation techniques to create a mesmerizing visual experience. Each dimension carries its own unique style, perfectly reflecting the characters' personalities and emotions.Moreover, the movie doesn't merely rely on its stunning visuals. It introduces a captivating narrative that explores complex themes, such as identity, diversity, and the multiverse. Miles Morales, the Afro-Latino Spider-Man, takes center stage and becomes an emblematic hero for our times. His journey to self-discovery and embracing his powers is both relatable and inspiring.The film also delights fans with its interconnected multiverse, featuring various Spider-People from different dimensions. These characters, from Spider-Gwen to Spider-Man Noir, are well-developed and offer a sense of inclusivity that resonates with diverse audiences. The humor and chemistry among them bring an extra layer of depth to the story.The soundtrack deserves special mention.

The choice of music adds an extra layer of immersion that sets this movie apart.What makes ""Across the Spider-Verse"" truly exceptional is its ability to appeal to audiences of all ages. Kids are drawn in by the colorful visuals and exciting action sequences, while adults appreciate the sophisticated storytelling and nostalgic references.In summary, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" isn't just a movie; it's a cinematic masterpiece.

This film's impact on the world of cinema is undeniable, solidifying its place as the greatest movie of all time.",positive
78,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.(2 viewings, opening Thursday UltraScreen 6/1/2023, UltraScreen 6/7/2023)",positive
79,"The animations are fantastic. Something between 3D, comics and animated film. Other... Where to start? 2.5 hours of a festival of colors and chaos. The film seems to have been made by someone with serious ADHD while on LSD. There is rarely a pause between sentences to process what has been heard. Combined with the cluttered animations, I had the impression that I was watching the movie at 1.5x speed. It can be seen that the film is totally adapted to new generations. Parents are friends instead of being parents, they use slang, everything is colorful, fast and ""adapted"" to short attention spans. There is no tension, the dialogues just flow without much expressiveness or meaning. There is more drama than action. Once again, the animations and style are absolutely phenomenal. The level of dialogues, scripts and everything else is not at the level of animations. The movie had to be at least half an hour shorter with a better story, less woke crap and far more suspense. This gives the impression that it is a Coca Cola advertisement. Due to excessive animations and hasty speech, the film is difficult to follow for long periods of time. A good idea, but the execution (except for the animations) is average at best.",positive
80,"The movie has left no place for the audience to not like about, everything about the movie is just PERFECT at its core. The details, the animation, the Easter eggs, the story line, the humor, the action, the suspense, EVERYTHING!However the disappointing thing could only be how the movie ended as a part. But that's absolutely alright, I wouldn't have liked if a movie of over 4 hours end quickly (since that thing happens in theatres all the time). I wish I could watch this movie for the first time again and again, because it's that amazing.Conclusion : If you haven't already watched this, just go to the nearest freaking hall and watch it already!! You're missing out a movie of a lifetime. Hope you love it just like everyone else.",positive
81,"This movie is absolutely incredible. I strongly recommend watching it in a theatre - I don't believe you'll get the full experience on your home screen/laptop/etc. Might I recommend you see it in IMAX if you can.The Spiderverse animated saga is going to be remembered as one of the defining film series of this generation.This is the Empire Strikes Back, the Dark Knight of this generation.I know comparisons aren't particularly helpful to anyone, but I can't think of a better way to describe this film. It is absolutely fantastic in every way a I would say even more so than its predecessor, which was already a 10/10 film. Visually dazzling, hilarious, tense, dramatic - Across the Spider-verse has it all.",positive
82,"Miles Morales continues to be a captivating protagonist, grappling with his identity and responsibilities in a way that feels relatable and deeply human. The chemistry and camaraderie among the Spider-heroes bring both heartwarming moments and exhilarating action sequences, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. It's a groundbreaking work of art that propels the superhero genre to new heights. With its flawless execution, rich character development, and breathtaking visuals, the film rightfully earns its place as a 10/10 cinematic triumph that will undoubtedly be celebrated for years to come. Need I say more?",neutral
83,"After waiting almost 4 and a half years this movie was worth every minute of the wait, it surpassed my expectations with flying colours. Every cameo made this movie even better for fans of other spider-men series and also shows what could've been in a different movie. Although the cliffhanger is slightly frustrating for a movie like this but it also sets up the next movie perfectly with Miles being in Earth-42 and Gwen being with the original spider-crew. This movie had been long awaited since the day into the spider-verse came out and has been a great success which has the next movie set up to be even better.",positive
84,"It was nothing short of spectacular and amazing. I didn't think they could surpass the animation of the first one, but this one clearly did. I was tearing up, not only because of how emotional it gets, but because of how beautiful the visuals are. I really liked that it was just good animation for the sake of good animation, because believe me, it was really good. But the good animation also served as somewhat of a way to differentiate between different universes. And by conditioning the viewers into thinking this, the twist is able to really shock them when it is revealed. Already can't wait for the next one!",positive
85,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" does an incredible, if not, amazing job of keeping the audience totally immersed in the story. With a perfect balance of telling and showing with its unmatched comic like animation, fresh and free flowing dialogue with undertones of humor and seriousness alike (achieving a perfect mix, adding to the story with cinematic aspects amplifying tone), outstanding street and abstract art and coloring along with beautiful cinematic lighting alike and masterful storytelling seamlessly completing the character arc of even the newer characters, hooking viewers deeper and deeper into the story unraveling every level (there's so many levels to this. Not to much. Just right. Oh soo good!) with every scene or sequence of scenes and act along with the totally insane and literally out-of-this-world action sequences and effortlessly engaging sound scape. A total must-see. A masterclass in storytelling and digital animation. Absolutely Brilliant in every way. Huge thanks to the Directors, Producers, Writers, Animators and Sound scape teams and Actors. Absolutely CANNOT wait for Beyond The Spider-Verse.",positive
86,"I'm so surprised to see such good ratings for this movie. This movie was definitely not a ""masterpiece."" It had a number of problems that are unavoidable and I'm dumbfounded that people aren't talking about them. I think in the end this movie probably deserves 6 or 7 out of 10The graphics:
First, to not be a complete downer, I will say what I believe to be the best part: the visuals! The art! The style! I think it's undeniable that the graphics in this movie are groundbreaking. They do make me excited for the future. My one problem with them is that they were a bit overdone. It seems like the graphics team realized that their graphics were great and so they really pushed them. A bit too much in my opinion. They were also a bit jarring at times, switching between beautiful artistic scenes and obvious cgi.My main problem:
The pacing of this movie is god awful. The worst pacing Ive seen in a big superhero movie for a long time. The first half is fine. The second half dragged. There were a number of unneccesary scenes that added nothing to the plot and were pretty boring (if you ignore the art, which is again pretty good).I have a theory for what happened to this movie. It feels like the writers had an idea for one movie and some executives forced them to split it into two. As other people have mentioned, this movie is NOT contained within itself. This would be fine, except it feels like it could have ended at least 45 minutes before the actual end. Plus the quality drops dramatically in the second half.Another problem:
The dialogue is terrible. If you listen to what the characters are saying, and ignore the graphics (which admittedly are amazing) you'll realize they are cliche and awful. Super cringy.The jokes are pretty funny in the first half. They get very unfunny in the second half. The same problem as most of the movie really.All in all. Worth it for the graphics. If not for the graphics, this movie would be below subpar. As it is, slightly better than mid.",positive
87,"Amazing. Spectacular. Sensational. Marvellous. This movie is a celebration of art, a celebration of culture, a celebration of superheroes and comic books, and a celebration of the one and only Spider-Man. The most ambitious, vibrant, bombastic, stylistic, feat in animation history. And an incredibly unique soundscape and score that feels sonically refreshing. This film is gushing with personality. It's unprecedented. It's unmatched. There is no competition. There is no doubt. This trilogy is going to be the greatest comic book adaptation of all time. Take notes MCU. Take notes everybody. This is how you do cinema. Excelsior!",positive
88,"Ok, my title is deliberately snarky, but ...Like the first movie, the animation here is spectacular. Plus, there are lots of incidental pleasures, mainly seeing all the different Spidermen and their crazy powers and costumes.However, I just wasn't that taken with the characters and plot. Maybe I'm too old for these sorts of films, but do we really need scene after scene of whiny teenagers talking about their feelings? Personally, all I really want from a Spiderman movie is some fun web action and a few zingy one liners. And a more interesting villain than the one we got here.Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I always thought the point of superheroes was to be focused on others - saving the world and all that - not endlessly dissecting their own emotions and obsessing about their families and relationships. Guess this just reflects the world we live in: a Spiderman movie for the me, me, me generation.",neutral
89,"I have no idea how this movie has so many positive reviews. I went to watch this with high hopes and left feeling like I just spent 2 hours inside of someone's head with a bad case of ADHD. It was moving so fast that there was no time for plot development, character development, and certainly no way for me to retain any of what I just watched.I'm giving it two stars for the animation, because I can always appreciate that someone put effort into something that required some creativity. But that being said, I remember almost nothing of that movie except how boring it was. It was moving so fast that it was completely impossible to actually enjoy, or even absorb it.I really hope the fine art of filmmaking isn't being lost when I see so many youths think this is what a good movie is supposed to look like.",negative
90,"Greatest animated film is not a title I would give out lightly. It is up against some amazing films, like Wall-E, Toy Story, How to train your dragon 2, Up (pretty much most pixar movies). But Across the Spiderverse easily beats those films, something I never thought I would say.Animation/art style.The strongest part of this film is the animation. Every shot is this beautiful frame with so much going on. The comic book style animation just like the first film is excellently utilised. It is simply one of the most cinematic movies, and such a beautiful film, it really proves that animated films can be just as good as live action and not ""just for kids"".Story.Can't say too much without spoiling the movie but the story is super intriguing and explores some very interesting themes that the first film introduced but didn't really tackle all that much. It creates quite an emotional ride at times and the 'problem' that drives the plot forward is a really good one and simple yet unique idea even if it is introduced well into the movie.Characters.The characters are really developed past the funny bit that introduces the characters in the first film. Gwen's backstory is explored giving us more emotional investment in the film. Miles is funny and cool as ever, keeping his slight awkwardness.One of the antagonist (if you can really call him one) has a very justified motive that most people would agree with, all but Miles, this is why you can't really call him a bad guy per se.The true antagonist gas a really cool design, costume and character wise, his backstop is goofy and his introduction is too but he evolves throughout the film into this really cool villain.Side characters are interesting especially one of them that is all about going against the establishment.Background characters were honestly one of this movies strengths, there were so many characters that showed up even for a second or two that made me gasp and gave me a huge grin, don't want spoil any as part of the enjoyment from this film are the different spidermen you meet.",positive
91,"I think this is actual cinema perfection. No joke, this movie has all of it. Insane plot and insane execution. The animation is a great to even view and it dazzles you every second of the way. Being an enormous fan of the 1st (#1 favorite movie of all time) this topped it. This is my new favorite movie of all time. The ending with Miles turning out to be the prowler in his dedicated universe had my jaw on the floor all the way home. This is one of the best movies created and it is this generations The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption. I'm so excited for Part 2 and I want to say from the bottom of my heart, this is the best movie Marvel has ever made.",positive
92,"I've heard about Into the spider-verse for a long time and yet I haven't seen it. Until Across the spider-verse arrived. So I decided
to watch it. After watching ITSV I keep asking myself ' Where Am I? 'After watching ITSV for 8 hours Now I'm ready for ATSV. When I walked out the cinema I was shocked. Ok Sony this one is PHENOMENAL! I ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second. This movie is in another level of animation now. Every frames are absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Every characters are full of heart. The story is beyond my expectations and I'm sure that yours too. Just three words for it ""I Love It""If you love spiderman(s), If you love Marvel, If you love animation, If you love Movies or If you are a guy spending your time at the cinema every weekend like me.GO WATCH IT!!",positive
93,"95/100The Into the Spider-Verse garnered much praise for its unique art style, and this sequel takes it to a whole new level. The homage to both classic and current comic book art is truly remarkable. Across the Spider-Verse looks like a masterpiece that belongs in an art museum. This is the kind of cinematic experience that keeps me coming back to the movies.However, it's not just visually stunning; it has depth and substance. Despite introducing more characters, each one is fully developed. In the first act, we delve deep into the family matters of Miles and Gwen, which adds an intriguing layer to their characters. The emotional pay-offs in the third act are incredibly powerful because of the excellent groundwork laid earlier. Every character's journey feels relatable, and the choices they face are genuinely difficult. It's impressive how this animated film manages to evoke such profound emotions. And with Beyond the Spider-Verse still to come, it seems we're in for even more of these satisfying pay-offs.Moreover, the movie is delightfully self-aware. It cleverly pokes fun at the Spider-Man tropes we've seen recycled countless times, generating plenty of laughs along the way. Jake Johnson's portrayal of Peter B. Parker is as hilarious, if not more so, than in the first film. Daniel Kaluuya's Spider-Punk had me chuckling with every line he delivered. The well-balanced humor provides a perfect counterbalance to the movie's darker moments, which are expertly executed, particularly thanks to Isaac Oscar's outstanding portrayal of Miguel. I didn't really expect the movie to go this dark, but thank god it did. It really worked.This film is absolutely spectacular! There is no doubt in my mind I just watched the winner of the Oscar for the best animated feature.",positive
94,"I went into this movie expecting it to be good but I didn't think it would surpass its predecessor 'Into the Spider-verse'. Boy, was I wrong and I've never been more happy to be wrong!!! Not only is this the greatest Spiderman film ever, I'm going to take it a couple of steps further and say that its the greatest animated film of all time and a top 5 comic book film of all time. I'd put this movie in the same tier as 'The Dark Knight', 'Avengers: Infinity War', 'Logan' it is THAT good. This movie was an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I fully expect this movie to sweep the Oscars for animated films and I expect it to be a candidate for film of the year!!!! I highly recommend everyone go see this film asap.",positive
95,"I don't even know where to start. I already had unhealthy high expectations for this movie, yet it still exceeded those expectations far beyond reach. It lives up to its title by plunging us right back into the chaotic madness of the multiverse by delving into Gwen's perspective, exploring her dynamics with her family and the hardships that come with juggling two different identities while not letting either one overlap or dominate. The Gwen-centered prologue spans for a whopping 15 minutes. It chronicled everything from dramatic character-affirming moments and extravagant artistic expression to mesmerisingly fluid action sequences and laugh-out-loud snippets of levity. It's basically a microcosm of what we are about to expect from the remaining runtime, giving us just a taste of the absolute carnage that is bound to unfold. And my god, did this movie deliver!This sequel stands tall alongside Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day as one of the worthiest successors of a pre-established masterpiece. But it's not only a masterpiece, it's a true work of art. It lies one step above masterpiece. It's a Renaissance painting come to life. You can just randomly pause at a scene and take a screenshot and it'll be a beautiful wallpaper. I thought Into The Spider-Verse was the pinnacle of superhero storytelling. Man, I was never this wrong. I'm telling you this blows Into The Spider-Verse out of the freaking water. It not only reaches new heights. It tears up the sky and shoots you beyond the stratosphere. I am shocked to the core at how revolutionary this movie is. I have never seen anything like it. The experience I had in the cinema is nothing short of spellbinding. This movie had me strapped on tight in my seat right from the get go, then had me in a suffocating stranglehold, refusing to loosen its grip, let alone let go, and throttled me towards a rollercoaster ride of emotions and feelings, I don't even know how to react.This is a mindblowing experience that left me speechless at times, laughing for the most part, and utterly petrified by its closing hour. My eyes were glued to the screen for the entire time, I never felt the 2-hour-and-20-minute runtime and it felt like I was right there beside the characters. My jaw was wide open the entire time, I could not believe what I was being exposed to. And I thought watching Infinity War and Endgame was the high point of my moviegoing experience. No, this is not only a cinematic experience I will never forget. This is something else entirely. This is something special. This is a cinematic miracle. The fact that they pulled this off with flying colours is insane. Everybody is firing on all cylinders. From the seamless blend of countless different animation styles, the striking colours, the stark contrasts, to the deliberate compositions, this is a visual feast unlike any other. This is a textbook testament to the creative potential of animation. There can be a scene with two people talking, and the background is filled with so much detail. Every single frame, shot and sequence is meticulously devised and painstakingly choreographed. It's lively, it's dynamic, it's moving.And amidst the dizzying array of visual cacophony lies a story that chronicles what it means to be Spider-Man. Again Miles (alongside his fellow Spider-companions) is flung head-first into wave after wave of emotional peril, exploring themes of adolescent isolation, complexities of growing up, and finding where he belongs in this vast expanse of multiversal entropy. He is put in situations that tests his resolve and integrity as a human being and as a universe-hopping superhero, clashing with different Spider-people when they present conflicting ideologies. And the way the creative team executed these moral dilemmas is nothing short of intelligent and mature by not giving us any easy or simple answers, but making us question along with the characters what the right decision is and what we would do if we are in their shoes.Not to mention, The Spot turned out to be one of most menacing villains ever to have graced the silver screen. He started out as a goofy ""villain of the week"", but then more layers get peeled off and we get to witness this 3-dimensional sculpture of a misunderstood and unfortunate guy sucked into the wrong end of a calamity. They actually made us care and understand where he's coming from, why he is the way he is, and why he's doing what he's doing. And the new Spider-people all have distinct personalities and some of them get to really shine under the spotlight. The core of the story doesn't ever get lost amidst the wild collection of cameos and Easter eggs. The team behind this franchise show that they have formed a tightly-knit kinship about what they are cooking up and what kind of a story they are trying to tell.Also, when the action settles down, the dust clears and the superheroes take off their costumes, the movie does not get less interesting. This is a grounded drama as much as it is a superhero spectacle. The dialogue in this movie is so sharp and witty, it cuts like a water jet. It takes what the first movie established and built upon that foundation by deepening the relationships of the characters and weaving more intricate elements into Miles' journey of self-discovery. And we get to just marvel at the complications and how it all plays out. Everything is laid bare. The characters are put front and center, flanked by breathtaking visual ingenuity, sharp sound design, powerful voice acting and Daniel Pemberton's sublime musical presentation.This sequel is more than a sequel. This is the best Spider-Man film ever made. This is the best superhero film ever made. This is the best animated film ever made. This is the best film of the year and possibly the best film to have come out in recent years. And it's not even close. It is a love letter to the Spider-Man canon, poking fun at familiar tropes but not forgetting to inject fresh oil to keep the engine purring. They went above and beyond for this. Every single aspect here screams perfection, from the calculated directing to the slick editing.There is not a single nanometre of a weak link. The web of life and destiny is woven with tour-de-force cinematic artistry. I am telling you that we are witnessing the birth of one of the greatest film trilogies ever made in cinematic history. I have no reason to doubt that Beyond The Spider-Verse is going to be as excellent as its era-defining predecessors. This is truly a flawless achievement that keeps you at the edge of your seat for the conclusion. See you next March!",positive
96,"I thought I'd watch it when the film was back in theaters. It was a disappointment for me. The concept is very nice, but it didn't carry the movie. The animation style is good from an artistic and aesthetic perspective, but it makes understanding the scenes difficult. It's very hard to grasp what's happening in most scenes. As for the plot, it's unnecessarily long and overly complex, and leaving the ending open-ended was a very wrong choice. Aside from all that, I found it generally unsuccessful in conveying emotions to the audience. Throughout the movie, I felt almost nothing, and there were moments when I was quite bored and disconnected from the film. There's a lot more to say, but I won't extend it further, partly because some of it would be negative. Considering that I'm a serious Spider-Man fan, you can somewhat understand why I was disappointed.",neutral
97,"Across the Spider-Verse has done the impossible: be better than Into the Spider-Verse. And by leaps and bounds too. The animation is spectacular. Every frame looks like a Van Gogh, a Picasso. It makes Into the Spider-Verse look like a first grader painted it. The voice cast is very well done, Oscar Isaac, Haliee Steinfeld, and Andy Samberg are definite highlights. The action sequences are superb, but they complement a fantastic story that when its massive cliffhanger hits you, you'll be begging for more. Daniel Pemberton brings his A game once again with a score that's even better than the first. Across the Spider-Verse succeeds in every way, and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.",positive
98,"Normally I'd round 6.5 up to a 7 but I'd begrudge doing so for this fare. The art style blew me away in the first one and it's pretty good here but not good enough for a free pass. I don't know why they had to make it so long for it to end on a ""TBC"". For me it sums up how I feel about this movie that I don't even care how this finishes, sure I'll probably watch the sequel at some point on a Sunday afternoon. The villain is hardly in the movie and it's just expecting me to sit back and enjoy the various settings and characters, which if this was the first film in this style would be enough. Glad I didn't fall for the hype and spend money at the cinema.",positive
99,"Either this movie is getting it's score bumped up by bot accounts, or I watched a ""mid"" version from another dimension.I'm honestly baffled by all reviews that I've seen for this movie. It's far from a masterpiece, but the critics who are speaking out against the film are seemingly doing so for clicks. Filling their ""review"" with zingers and half backed complaints about the movies undoubtedly fantastic art direction and animation.This movie falls flat when it comes to pacing and plot. The first half of the movie had me engaged, despite drawn out character moments (which are arguably needed, I'd just argue they could flow better and cut down on runtime) and the fact that we don't see Miles get pulled into the main plotline until a round half way through the film had me loosing some interest admittedly. This was something reviewers took into account for other films, like the first of The Hobbit trilogy, so why does this film get a pass?I was definitely ready to check out when we got to the scene on the bridge in Mumbai and Gwen was the only one to get an alert about a breach in the ""cannon"". How we can we blame Miles or Gwen for doing a sloppy job when the writing is sloppier? Why didn't anyone else present on the bridge get an alert? Why didn't Pavitr know about this cannon event like everyone else? When it's heavily insinuated that all of the Spider-Men/woman working for Miguel know about all of this stuff and are actively working to avoid a multiversal doomsday event.",positive
100,"Rarely do I give movies 9 stars, and rarely do I think watching a movie is actual ""fun"". But this was, without any hesitation, great and literal fun. There are some logical flaws which will appear during the viewing, nonetheless the animation is impeccable and how the story goes is also great. Recommendation without hesitation.On a side node: This is how you make poc people being represented well. Not randomly switching skin colors, but making great characters of their own. At this point Morales is literally edging on the popularity of Peter Parker. Just make cool characters!If you're unsure; Watch it.",positive
101,This movie is beautiful stunning amazing work of art this movie needs a 8.9 rank on IMDb. This movie meets all expectations even the animation is stunning beautiful film. I love the story of it yet again like the first the story never fails to amaze me. This film is beautiful brilliant work of art it works in so many ways like Gwen Stacy story her background is beautiful I love the emotion she feels with her dad the scenes of her and her dad are amazing the background changes every time it's amazing. Miles story is beautiful as well he's dad loves him he loves he's dad and I love this movie. I.,positive

103,"This type of movie is the type where you're going to watch it 10 years later and still say this movie is perfection. It took the animation to a whole new level and it made a big leap in the animation world that all the companies will have a big challenge to compete with it. And I'm sure the impact will stay for a decade at least just like avatar and the matrix movies.The cameos and the little details that not anyone will notice it like spider-man fans it makes the story even better.And saving the best for the last, story and the plot, i cant talk much about it because of it will contain spoilers but if there's a sentence to describe it. It was a true masterpiece.I really doubt that we will get the same level of this movie in the meantime but all I can say this movie os ahead of its time.I recommend to watch it on iMax with best resolution it will deliver a better experience.",positive
104,"In My 14 years of life I have never seen a better superhero movie than this masterpiece right here, I was 9 when the first movie in this series was released and I had VERY high hopes and My hopes were met a a ton more, I can not recommend this movie enough, I loved all the characters and the amount of references to older Movies, shows and even Video games was so nice to see, hell there was even a Lego universe which was pretty funny, all I have to say is Miguel Ohera is cool, And the most of the movie is amazing. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending, the fact it was a Cliffhanger was kind of bad And I can't wait 9 Months until Part two, I can not complain though because this movie is amazing.",positive
105,"Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it's also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you'd expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey's seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it's moments - assuming you can catch it - and there's a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole ""multiverse"" theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I'm not sure I'll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for ""Miles"" and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",positive
106,"Wow how can u make this amazing of a movie? It's a mistery known to Men, like holy s#!t how good is this movie, the amination for 100 milion dolars is prety awsme i didn't know that you can make animation even beter then the first one, like this movies animation goes full on comic-book style. Now for the story. The story is a lot More darker then first one and the Gwen Stacys world is so great, and we get More of her backstory, like we all knew it is sad ,but holy cow how sad it. We get the full version of her backstory, that peter drank sience stuff that Made him the Green Goblin is sad and how her dad thinks she killed him ( spider women ) is sad this movie is emotional and great, overall FANTASTIC MOVIE !!!! GO SEE IT !!!",positive
107,"Big fan of the first Spider Verse. Still loved the vision this film had. Spot was a huge villain miss along with any fighting scenes with focus on portals, which was not enjoyable to follow. I liked how the film incorporated a deeper and familial storyline, but it lacked good writing. The humor had potential and at times I did laugh but I ended up getting bored of it. I think this film will resonate with kids rather than adults. Wow, the world is changing considering this film just didn't resonate with my 43 year old mindset, a familiar sentiment across every adult I talked to that watched this film.",positive
108,"Spider-man: across the spider-verse is a sequel to the animated hit, but it misses the mark for me. The movie attempts to continue the multiverse story with a lot of visual flair, but it ends up feeling overwhelming and chaotic. The storyline is complex and convoluted, making it hard to follow and enjoy. The animation style is unique, but it can be a bit too much at times, with rapid changes in color and pace that feel jarring.For kids, the movie is not a great choice - it's too complex and visually intense. It lacks the charm and simplicity that made earlier Spider-Man movies enjoyable for a broader audience. Overall, I found it to be a disappointing sequel that didn't live up to the original's promise. I give it a 2/10 for its ambition, but it's not something I'd watch again.",positive
109,"After watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse i think it's best animated movie ever made but, than BANG!! And Epic ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" swing beyond my wildest dreams! As a long-time Spider-Man enthusiast, I had high expectations for the much-anticipated 3rd installment of this frenchise. This animated masterpiece is a thrilling and visually stunning journey that takes us on a multiverse-spanning adventure with our friendly neighborhood Spider-People.Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is not just a movie; it's an immersive experience that redefines the boundaries of animation. Building on the groundbreaking success of its predecessor, this sequel dives deeper into the multiverse, delivering a visual spectacle that is matched only by its emotional depth.One of the film's strongest assets is its exceptional animation. The film is a stunning showcase of artistic innovation. Each universe is a distinct visual treat, from the neon-soaked metropolis of Gwen Stacy's world to the watercolor-esque beauty of Spider-Man India's realm. The animation is fluid, dynamic, and expressive, capturing the essence of each character with unparalleled detail. Every frame is a work of art, inviting multiple viewings to uncover hidden gems.Beyond its visual brilliance, Across the Spider-Verse boasts a mature and thought-provoking story. Miles Morales, our beloved protagonist, is confronted with the complexities of heroism as he grapples with the weight of his responsibilities. The introduction of a council of Spider-People adds depth to the narrative, exploring different interpretations of what it means to be a hero. The film doesn't shy away from darker themes, delivering a powerful message about identity, destiny, and the sacrifices that come with greatness.The voice acting is exceptional. Shameik Moore continues to shine as Miles Morales, capturing the character's youthful exuberance and growing maturity. Hailee Steinfeld's Gwen Stacy is a standout, delivering a complex and emotionally resonant performance. The ensemble cast, including Oscar Isaac as Spider-Man 2099 and Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, brings a wealth of talent to the screen.Another commendable aspect is the film's emotional depth. Miles' struggles with the responsibility of being a hero and dealing with personal dilemmas are beautifully portrayed. The movie doesn't shy away from exploring the complexities of friendship and loss, making it relatable and compelling for both young and adult audiences.While the film is a cinematic triumph, it ends on a cliffhanger that leaves audiences eager for the next installment. While this can be frustrating, it's also a testament to the film's ability to create a compelling and ongoing narrative.One thing bothered me is that this film doesn't win Oscar for best animated movie. How can that even possible that this movie can't win oscar, if this movie don't get oscar than it's oscar's loss not it's.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a cinematic masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of animation and storytelling. It's a visual spectacle and an emotional rollercoaster. It's a film that will leave you breathless, entertained, and emotionally invested. It seamlessly blends humor, heart, and action, creating a captivating web that will enthrall audiences from start to finish. This is a must-watch for fans of the genre and anyone who appreciates exceptional filmmaking. I can't wait to see how this ambitious and exhilarating story continues in the next installment.",positive

111,"Into The Spiderverse was very good. Across The Spiderverse is undeniably a masterpiece. The story, the art, the acting, and everything in between is stellar. I haven't walked out of a theater wanting to watch a superhero movie, immediately again, like this, since The Dark Knight. Across The Spiderverse brings you on an adventure that is mesmerizing, funny and unforgettable. The creators manage to make me feel like a kid again, as if watching Spiderman for the first time all over again. You do not want to miss a single moment of this, electrifying, rollercoaster of a movie. Truly something to behold.",positive
112,"There isn't a scene that is not art in this movie, it is truly a work of art, the music and themes are beautiful, as an artist i can safely say this is the most beautiful movie I've seen, it's almost overwhelming.The story follows the first movie well, but the visuals are what we are *really* here for, this movie is 2 hours and a half long, and yet it goes by so quickly because of how fluid everything is.The only issue is sometimes you cant hear the dialogue too well, I originally thought it was due to my theatre, but later found out it's an actual issue, but it didn't matter too much anyways.I love talking about how good this movie is, and i am usually not a ""movie lover"" myself, but it's pieces like these that really wow me, i even bought the movie on Prime Video so i can watch it and appreciate it as much as i want.I hope to be able to support this film and their creators/animators by reviewing it everywhere, promoting it, and buying it, it's just that good.The best animated movie i have seen so far in my short lifetime, and deserves all the love it needs.",positive
113,"As with the first film but upping the ante a notch, this sequel reinstates the choices made before. Sony has made such a genious move. They developed a style on their own, which cannot be plagiarized without backfiring on whoever does it. Bold, successful move. Haven't seen something like this since What dreams may come (1998).And it's not a case of all looks and no substance either. The story backs the visuals, and it wasn't until 15 minutes from the end that I noticed the movie wouldn't wrap in this installment. The pace, story and cinematic choices really draw you into it, so much so that you don't notice time passing by.If I have only one criticism is that in fact pace is so fast that one might miss several references or jokes. Other than that, congratulations on Sony and Marvel for setting new and higher standards.",neutral
114,It was a decent movie sequel to the last one but...This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm not a fan of the spider verse type of animation. It was cool and unique at first in part 1 but the undefined and blurry edges and glitching is really a strain on my brain. It cannot be good for anyone who suffers from epilepsy.It's like they took everyone's version of each scene and just superimposed them so there are like 3 colours in each edge and several edges and no one has colored within the lines!It was also really loud and glitchy.Getting a bit tired of extremely disobedient child superheroes too. Guess I'm just too old school.,positive

116,"This film swings high on ambition and style, but it lands with a thud in several key areas. The film's vibrant animation is undeniably a visual feast, pushing boundaries and offering moments of creative brilliance. Yet, this very innovation can be a double-edged sword. At times, the animation becomes visually overwhelming and confusing, making it hard to follow the action, especially in the frenetic scenes. The soundtrack, while energetic, often drowns out the dialogue and emotional beats, contributing to an overall sensory overload. The film's opening sequence, a lengthy and chaotic fight, sets a tone of relentless noise and movement that can feel exhausting rather than exhilarating.Miles Morales, while a charismatic character, sometimes comes across as annoyingly self-important. His tendency to act as though he's more special than the other Spider-People starts to wear thin, especially when the narrative insists on showcasing his uniqueness at the expense of others. A particularly frustrating moment occurs during a long chase scene where, despite being pursued by a seemingly endless array of Spider-People, Miles manages to evade capture with little effort. This plot device stretches credibility and can be jarring, detracting from the film's impact.While the film's technical achievements are impressive, I can't help but feel that Across the Spider-Verse is somewhat overrated. The pacing also leaves something to be desired. The film spends so much time setting up its multiverse mechanics and introducing new characters that it often loses sight of the central story; the first act, in particular, drags on. And while the cliffhanger ending is meant to leave us wanting more, I found it frustrating and unsatisfying, especially after the movie's lengthy runtime.Ultimately, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" feels overhyped. While it has its high points, the film's excesses often overshadow its strengths, making it a less enjoyable experience than its predecessor.",neutral
117,"Great film. I loved the animation and voice acting, and a top-tier sequel to the amazing film: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. I love the emotional scenes in the film and the comedy. The Spot, at first, was indeed ""A villain of the week"". But, eventually, his character arc comes full-circle as he becomes, arguably, the most dangerous villain Spider-Man has ever faced. Gwen Stacy takes Peter B. Parker's place from the first film, but Peter B. Still plays an important role in the film. The new characters, such as Hobie Brown (Spider-Punk), Pavitr Pubhakar (Spider-Man India) and Miguel O'Hara (Spider-Man 2099) were fantastic new characters. The Spider society had some excellent members, even if they weren't key parts of the film, such as Spider-Cat. Metro Boomin' had such good songs for the film. Would recommend!",positive
118,"Music hits the feels at every perfect note, returning characters have great growth throughout the story, and new faces are enticing, and dont even get me started on the animation. Whole story is perfect, has its comedic and heartfelt moments that never feel out of place. Villain origin is hilarious, but given how much animation importance was placed on the (redacted) in the original, it does kind of make sense. If you havent seen it, treat yourself and see this. If you have seen it before, treat yourself and watch it again to see how many easter eggs you can find (only see it once so far and I saw quite a few). Instant classic.",positive
119,"TLDR: Impeccable movie that has everything you'd wish for it to have. Great story, amazing action, interesting characters and ethereal visuals. Worth watching at least twice in the theaters.It's clear how passionate the people working on this series are. Like with most other movie-series, I expected ATSV, a sequel, to be good but not as good as ITSV. But, dare I say, ATSV is on par with ITSV, if not better. There are so many tiny details and easter eggs for hardcode comic readers. The pacing of the story is impeccable with no segment stretched too far out or cut too short.Props to the animators for this masterful piece. I love how the color of Gwen's world switches between blue, red and purple, implying how she and people close to her are feeling at that time. Notice how the color pink/red starts spreading out when she hugs her dad for the first time in the movie. Another thing I noticed is that the facial expressions of all the characters are more expressive and refined at the same time, compared to ITSV. For example, the subtle lopsided smile on Gwen's face near the end of the movie when she tells Miles' parents she's going to find him; the tranquil expression on the faces of Miles and Gwen when they're sat upside-down below the ledge of a building; and many more such instances.They did diversity so right by consulting the voice actors of the same heritage and ethnicity as their character, on how the character and their world should be designed, making everything seem so original and authentic.Miles' character development is amazing. Miguel says so many hurtful things to him at the end of their fight on top of the ""bullet-ish"" train (which is implied in the trailer as well. So, not a spoiler). ITSV Miles would've let all of that talk get to him and would've felt discouraged and beaten. But, ATSV Miles really said, ""Nah, Imma do my own thing"", literally and figuratively. It implies how confident and strong he has grown mentally since ITSV. Hobie was such a class act, as was Pavitr. I'm glad we're going to see more of them in BTSV.The only thing about the movie that pains me is that it ended in a massive cliffhanger with no solid conclusion other than the reunion of team Miles with the addition of a few more spider-people. The wait for BTSV is going to feel very long.Lastly, as an Indian, I'd like to re-establish that 'chai' means tea and the word 'naan' itself implies or is inclusive of the word 'bread'.",positive
120,"First off, I see a ton of reviews knocking this movie, giving it a low score mainly for the movie leaving in a cliffhanger... are you serious? Who knew it's a requirement to not leave a movie in a cliffhanger in order for it to be a good movie.I have seen Across the Spiderverse 4 times in theaters. Each time going into the theater I think the movie won't catch my eye like the last watch, and every time I'm wrong. The whole movie is complete eye candy. The animation is incredible, the colors, the art styles. Even from the opening credits... the amount of effort that went into the credits must've been ridiculous.The story has a really nice pace. While having suspenseful and emotional moments in there as well which really hit close to home. The plot was clever with The Spot. Turning from a joke to a serious threat. I loved the music that was used. A lot of the jokes hit. The characters introduced weren't overwhelming, and there were some returning characters which was a nice surprise.I mainly wanted to make this review to say if you rate this movie anything less than an 8 it's just a total insult to everyone who worked on this movie. The animation alone is way better than Into the Spiderverse. Absolutely stunning. There are also plenty of great movies out there that end on cliffhangers, Infinity War being one. This movie is among the greats, regardless of what you may think of the ending.",positive
121,"I honestly couldn't believe that this movie was better then its predecessor in every aspect. First of all the animation was equally as good as ITSV and i know that the animators took their time to make this as best as possible and i appreciate that they took their time making this movie instead of just making it quickly and having it be a horrible movie. Secondly i love how each character had their own small part in the movie and i loved every single character that was shown on screen especially Hobie Brown. And last of all the cliffhanger was so GOOD but i was so sad it ended but its a good way to set up the big finale ""Beyond the Spider-Verse"" and i cannot wait to see it in theaters on March 29th. Overall this masterpiece of a movie was spectacular.",positive
122,"As an avid fan of the Spider-Verse franchise, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the highly anticipated sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Let me tell you, this film did not disappoint. In fact, I dare say it surpassed its predecessor and established itself as a superior film.One of the most remarkable aspects of Across the Spider-Verse is its stunning visuals. The film seamlessly incorporates various forms of animation, creating a visually breathtaking spectacle. Every frame is a work of art, and the animation is so daring and innovative that even the simplest dialogue scenes are elevated to new heights.What sets this film apart is its ability to balance its visual extravaganza with a smart, character-driven story. It explores themes of fate, friendship, and the sacrifices heroes must make. The joy of discovery and emotional generosity, which were the soul of the original Into the Spider-Verse, are still present in abundance. The film manages to be inventive, thrilling, funny, ridiculous, heartwarming, frenetic, and even sad, all at once.Across the Spider-Verse also deserves praise for its willingness to entrust its storytelling to its animation. The visuals not only enhance the story but become an integral part of it, propelling the narrative forward in unexpected ways. The film takes risks, and they pay off splendidly.The movie's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers yearning for more, and it's a bittersweet realization that we'll have to wait until March 2024 for the conclusion. Nonetheless, this film stands on its own as an instant classic. It maintains the whimsical energy of its predecessor while offering a fresh perspective with a slightly different writing lineup.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and groundbreaking animation. It raises the bar for animated films and leaves a lasting impression with its thrilling action, engaging characters, and visual splendor. This is a cinematic experience that should not be missed.",neutral
123,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings onto the screen with an exhilarating blend of stunning animation, heartfelt storytelling, and a fresh take on the beloved Spider-Man mythos. This animated masterpiece takes the superhero genre to new heights, delivering a visually captivating experience that's matched only by its depth of emotion and creativity.The film's unique visual style, combining comic book aesthetics with cutting-edge animation techniques, creates a visual feast for the eyes.

This film isn't just a must-watch for Spider-Man fans; it's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the magic of storytelling brought to life on the big screen.",positive
124,This movie is good and has some interesting scenes but missing the good writing of its predecesssor. Miles' relationship with his parents start to feel contrived and simplistic. The movie is not that interesting until the 90-min mark when a spectacular chase scene makes for the best patt of the movie. Not the sequel that eveyone claims it is. For a better sequel go see Dune Part 2 or Terminator 2.For me the writing was not as innovative or heartfelt as part one and only served to have some cool grafics with much less substance. Hope part 3 can find the right balance and bring the best spiderman back to the screen.,positive
125,"Don't write many reviews, but this film deserves every bit of it's 10/10 score. The film pulls you in with the crispiest animation images I've seen on the big screen - you seriously cannot watch this on a home TV screen to give it justice. Beautiful colours and sequences it leaves you in awe. The score and soundtrack is amazing and is like the glue that binds the images together and feels very much part of the feel and story - not just some random celeb hits added as an afterthought.The excellent script with its qwerks, twists, jokes and heart felt moments just capture you attention non-stop, that you don't have time to even contemplate how time has passed in the real world. I've watch Disney and other animation stuff checking watch or phone waiting for the end, but not one bit in this movie. It truly captures your attention from beginning to end.The cast are very well put together with each voice and actor just giving fantastically to the story in their unique ways.I went to watch on a non-cheap night at the cinema with the whole family and it's the first film in a long long time that I didn't feel a bit robbed and actually came out so glad my little monetary contribution has gone into the film for cast and crew. They have done a fantastic job. It is by far the best Spiderman film in all areas.It seriously is a must watch!",positive
126,"Let's state the obvious : this movie is just insanely gorgeous. Each dimension/universe has its own unique style, and the quality of the animation is just out of this world.That being said, I found this movie to be a humongus mess of expositionnal dialogue that stop the movie dead in its tracks.With more creative storytelling, they could have settled this opus in one movie! But no. The movie has to stop every time a new character is introduced so we can get its backstory. And yes, I'm aware they did that in the first movie. But, at that moment, it was fresh, and there weren't a billion of spider-men to introduce.In fact, I liked the way they introduced the characters in the first movie. I just wish producers would stop thinking that because we liked something in a movie, they have to put it everywhere in the future sequels. It sucks. We like something because it's new and fresh.Then, the movie has to stop to deal with so many parental issues. And yes, I understand it counts as character development, and I like a character to develop, but I hate it when the story has to stop for it to happen. It should happen through the story.I'll watch the third one, that's for sure. Be cause now that they removed all the backstory and idle drama, they'll be able to focus on the story, right?Right?",negative
127,"Spoiler alert: At 2 hours and fifteen minutes, this is not a complete movie, and unfortunately this was not clear before sitting through this. I was fine with the movie and thought that it was well done, however I dragged my spouse to it, whom I knew would not be a fan, and he was left with a worse feeling than I even expected. Needless to say that he will not be seeing the next installment. Following this movie, we then saw Fast and Furious X, which was also an unadvertised two parter. Hollywood needs to do a better job of alerting folks to this so that an informed decision can be made. It seems that movies are getting longer, and are we now seeing that even 2 1/2 hours isn't adequate to tell a story?",neutral
128,"The animation was absolutely amazing along with the action and soundtrack. Miles and Gwen definitely feel more fleshed out in this one, however I feel that some of the dialogue gets to be a bit too corny and tries to hard to be quirky. I expected Miguel to have more of a role aside from the final 30 minutes of the movie, same goes for the villain who is introduced with a rushed backstory who only makes 1 more appearance in the entire second half of the movie. I did have a good time watching it and it's by no means a bad movie, just not the ""Masterpiece"" everyone is building it up to be and is certainly not, ""The Greatest Animated Movie Of All Time"".",positive
129,"I was fortune enough to attend the premiere here in Singapore. A non-spoiler review follows:Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does more than just swing into action; it weaves a narrative tapestry with passion, dedication, and love. The creators of this epic journey have clearly poured their heart and soul into every frame, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.The animation is a tour de force, seamlessly blending diverse art styles that bring the Spider-Verse to life in a way that feels vibrant and fresh. Each scene is a feast for the eyes, painting the screen with a burst of colors and imaginative designs that will leave you breathless.Equally commendable is the strength of the narrative that effortlessly connects with the audience. The story doesn't just unfold; it entangles you in its web, ensuring that you are invested in every dramatic interaction, every thrilling fight sequence, and every emotional climax.Character development is another highlight of the film. The growth our beloved characters undergo adds layers of depth to the story, making their journeys all the more engaging. Their interactions, whether action-packed or heartwarming, are captivating and contribute greatly to the film's overall quality.The score and soundtrack are also nothing short of fire, underscoring every moment with tunes that not only set the mood but also elevate the story to new heights.However, if I absolutely have to nitpick, there are a few moments when it seems to pull on the heartstrings a tad excessively. This slight overindulgence in sentimentality is a small nitpick in an otherwise excellent film.The way the Spider-Verse is portrayed, introduced, and expanded feels effortless and organic. You get a sense of a larger universe out there, waiting to be explored, which adds to the anticipation for the next part in this thrilling saga.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning and an emotionally gripping adventure. I, for one, can't wait to see where this journey takes us next.",positive
130,"It's not very often we get an animation film like this...The art is astounding, colorful visuals, a jaw dropping movie phenomenon. The score and songs flow very well, the acting is on par with new additional characters involved...Some we may know, and some we haven't seen on screen yet. The plot of the story is well thought out. Has its silly moments without taking away the essence of the story. Has a very dark tone. This is a movie is aimed not only for children but for comic fans and adults alike. They really achieved movie history and everyone involved did a stiller job! One of the best Spider-Man movies thus far!",positive
131,"Over many years, sequels have been known to sweep Hollywood off its feet. Making films like Empire strikes back and Top Gun Maverick which were absolutely superior to their predecessors in every way. Now Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse does that absolute feat after the audience patiently awaited for Miles Morales's return to the big screen after 5 years. Every single member of the Animation team poured their heart and soul's into each individual design for not only the locations but also each individual character. Even with this film being one piece of the pie, it is quite delectable in every way.Person note: In 2018,I experienced Miles Morales's origin for the first time when i watched Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse at the Cinemark Theater, which in all honesty became one of my favorite films of all time. It's animation was one of the most unique styles that I had laid my eyes on at the time. The use of a multiverse gave a perfect blend of characters to help Miles story grow. So after the film gained it's successful stardom, the announcement of a two parted sequel hit the internet by a storm of support, which is particularly the best reaction the internet could give. No one could comprehend how remarkable it would become.Across the Spider-Verse is what would be regarded as a Spider-Man fans dream film. It not only respects the source material given from the films, games and comics but it also gives a compelling story that everyone will love and isn't dragged by it's sheer amount of cameos. The easter eggs and references that are incorporated into the film are used very well and will in all honesty blow the audience's minds.",positive
132,"For the past two years, No Way Home was my favorite Spider-Man movie. Now, that title belongs to Across the Spider-Verse. Besides being a great Spider-Man movie, I'd consider this a great movie in general. I just saw Across the Spider-Verse, but I already feel comfortable placing this movie in the same category of sequels like The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, Terminator 2, and The Dark Knight, which surpass every aspect of their predecessors.I love Into the Spider-Verse as much as everyone else, but I believe Across the Spider-Verse improves everything from the first movie. The one part of Into the Spider-Verse that always held it back from a 10/10 to me is the villains. Kingpin and the Prowler are serviceable, but I always thought they were uninteresting. With Across the Spider-Verse, the villain is a major improvement. Miguel O'Hara had a compelling motivation, while also being a genuinely threatening antagonist.I already thought Into the Spider-Verse's animation was breathtaking, but Across the Spider-Verse somehow surpasses it. The entire movie looks like a work of art, but the highlight for me would be every scene in Gwen's universe. The backgrounds and colors in those scenes are gorgeous. Just like the first movie, the fights here are fast-paced and fun. There are plenty of memorable action scenes here, but I particularly loved the first fight between Miles Morales and the Spot.This is sort of out of topic, but I also think Across the Spider-Verse was a better multiverse movie than Multiverse of Madness. Not only was the concept of other dimensions better utilized in Across the Spider-Verse, they were also more visually distinct here. Maybe it's because of the fact that this movie is animated, but each dimension in Across the Spider-Verse was able to have their own style and color to them, unlike the ones featured in Multiverse of Madness.Overall, Across the Spider-Verse is yet another masterpiece in the Spider-Verse series. It's both my favorite Spider-Man movie and my favorite movie of 2023. I know this year isn't over yet, but it's going to be tough to top this movie. I give Across the Spider-Verse a 10/10.",positive
133,"My favorite movie of all time. Seen it twice less than 24 hours since it opened. Every frame is perfect. Every line of dialogue, story beat, voice actor, are all perfect. Metro Boomin's songs and Daniel Pemberton's score are perfect. I love every second of this movie. It hit me hard man. This is my Empire Strikes back, my Infinity War. Planning on seeing it again multiple times. See it on the best screen possible. I love Miles and Gwen's relationship. Miguel is a fantastic and complex character. There is so much here for every Spider-Man fan to enjoy. And there is plenty for people who aren't fans too.",positive
134,"When Spiderverse 1 came out back in 2018, it was one of the best movies that released. You were told a story that could tug on your heartstrings and make your stomach ache with laughter.It was a new concept for spiderman films, and we all had a great time.This new movie fails to match up to the original.They manage to keep you invested throughout the runtime, but I don't think that explains all the 9 and 10 star ratings on here.The good points to be made for Spiderverse 2 are the animation quality, the slow burn development of characters and making this seem like a movie for both adults and kids. However, this also takes away from the experience, as it keeps switching between trying to be family friendly and highly realistic about how the characters would behave.It's a conflicted film that is clearly about Miles, but for some reason wants it to be about Gwen as well. There are hundreds of cameos from comic book characters, but they also add in some live action ones that just don't have the impact they were going for.If you're making an animation movie, just stick to animation!We are well aware of what transpires in live action, and adding it here does little to boost the experience, unless you're some young kid who can point and scream about it.The story is also muddled, and doesn't have an idea of which direction to go in. Instead, it overloads you with visuals and a pretty decent soundtrack for nearly an hour and a half, before deciding it wants to focus on Miles again and ends after he gets stuck in a multiverse of madness predicament of sorts.The ending was the most annoying part of the entire film.(You sense the movie is about to end any minute, but then they keep pushing the runtime further and further, again just to create some sort of impact. The villain revealed at the end doesn't strike me as a threat, given they show you his face and then he tells you his name.)I do appreciate leaving the film on a cliffhanger, but the whole thing seems like a 2 hour trailer for the next movie. That's my biggest issue with what would otherwise be a decent sequel that tries something different from the first.It tries to fit too many things in its runtime, and fails at making any of it have any real weight once you leave.My theatre applauded the film after it ended, but now I'm not too sure why. It should have just focused on Miles right from the start, instead of taking too much time to get there.All in all, this movie opens up new avenues for storytelling in the spiderverse, and has superb animation quality.Unfortunately after trying to think about my overall experience, it would be summed up like this.The movie felt like it drowned itself in the cameos and maintaining the musical aesthethic rather than focusing on telling a story you could resonate with like the first one, and then choosing to end right after it decides to do exactly that.",positive
135,"One of the most overwhelming movie experiences of my life. A feast for the visual and auditory senses.I had HUGE expectations from this as the first one is one of my favourite animated movies of all time, and this one even surpassed those!It's one of the longest animated movies of Hollywood, but it doesn't drag for a single moment. There's so much happening in this film, it feels like a miracle that it still works so well! So many different animation styles, such great use of colours that portray the emotions of each scene perfectly, dope soundtrack, countless Easter Eggs; and it still doesn't feel exhausting. So many characters and almost all of them have distinct characteristics. You can sense that the creators have an amazing understanding of the characters, and they do them full justice.But it's not just a compilation of awesome psychedelic animation with some great score, it has a fascinating plot too. It handles the multiverse well, delivers a couple of neat plot twists, while being an emotional coming-of-age story of a couple of teenagers trying to balance their dual lives, and maintaining their relationship with their parents.It's the best Spider-Man film ever made. It's one of the best movies ever made.Now I can't wait for the final film which will establish the Spider-Verse trilogy as one of the greatest trilogies of all time.",positive
136,"The art is stellar which makes for a 100% visually appealing movie and a good 1/4 of the scenes are written perfectly. The problem is they stretched the main plot and parts of a second movie, all just to leave this movie at a middle point so you pay for another. Ending a movie in the middle is just lazy greed.Neither of the plotsjustify some grand multi-movie serialization.Was the movie good? Just barely. However in giving absolutely no resolution yet finding time to give the audience a red herring to think the end was near, was insulting.Watch it on some streaming service in two years when the next one is due out.",positive
137,"I had such high hopes for this sequel, but the extreme artistic liberties with the constantly shifting backgrounds made it difficult to follow the dialog, the emotional scenes lost their impact for me when the characters were changing colour with every camera angle shift.I enjoyed the continued character development and additions of all the new spidermen, but I just could not get past the non stop swirling, flashing and dripping colours.The extreme use of the glitching and flashing graphics had me closing my eyes for periods of time just to get a break, as well it made the fight scenes and swinging scenes very difficult to follow.I understand the first movie had taken liberties with artistic aspects as well but I feel the second film was just over done with them.I still love the story line and where the film is going I just hope for my heads sake they tone it down a little in the next film.",positive
138,"11/10 MOVIE. VERY STYLISH AND BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. I REALLY LOVE THE NEW CHARACTERS THEY INTRODUCED TO US, SPIDER-PUNK, 2099 SPIDERMAN AND MUCH MORE. OH AND I LOVE THE ASAP ROCKY POSTER REFERENCE IN MILES ROOM. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THERE WHEN I FIRST WATCHED IT AND I THOUGHT I WAS TWEAKING BUT I WASNT. I ALSO LOVED THE METRO BOOMIN CAMEO IN THE MOVIE, I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL N FUNNY. ANYWAYS I HOPE THIS MOVIE WINS 'MOVIE OF THE YEAR' AND I WILL LIVE PEACEFULLY. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL AND WELL DONE MOVIE.

139,"You would believe that nothing could top Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, only until you watch this sequel. I never really write reviews but WOW. This movie is living proof of what excellence in creativity looks like, how animation truly is a limitless art form that can bring life to the story.Every change throughout the movie is evident in the art style too, which makes it such a unique film.Words cannot describe the viewer experience. Getting bombarded by colour animations during fights, only to be followed by utterly hilarious dialogues and yet impactful scenes where raw emotion shows the true relation between the characters.Great choice of soundtrack, absolute incredible cinematography
An easy 10/10.",positive
140,"Didn't think they could top the first part but they clearly did. Everything was perfect, the story, the action scenes, the cinematography, the animation and the ending was wow.Another thing that was intriguing was how the tone of the movie keeps changing and it takes you on all the possible rides.This should be considered one of the best animated movies ever and not just the best spiderman movie ever.Can easily call this the best spiderman movie of all time... highly recommended.I made sure I watched part 1 again before starting, you enjoy it more that way so that's also recommended...",positive
141,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" swings in as an absolute game-changer.

And the emotions?Get ready for a ride. It's not just a movie; it's an experience that'll leave you begging for more. When the credits roll, you'll be on the edge of your seat, hungry for the next round.In a world full of predictable sequels, this one breaks free. It's fresh, exciting, and solid 10/10 material. If you're into stunning animation, heart-pounding action, and characters that stick, don't miss this web-slinging adventure.",neutral
142,"Very good! You will need to go back and watch the previous story to actually understand the full story that happened in this new one. I really liked how it was mostly animated base just like the previous movie was, at first I was very skeptical of watching since the whole movie was base of animated and very colorful. It definitely changed my mind and I feel like watching it unfold in animation was even better. Loved some of the new characters getting introduced and it really does continue the main story and goes further. I cannot wait to see the next part! Very excited and excited what may happen next.",positive
143,"This is a movie is a must watch after you see the first one. You will not be disappointed. Nicely made family movie. I also truly enjoyed that I didn't notice any subliminal targeting of sexuality. Miles is still trying to grown into himself and figure out who he is. He is a smart young man but struggles with balancing life as hero, student, and a son. This movie has some classic throwback moments that links it to other spider-man movies.You will be drawn into the movie quick and begging for more. It was very funny noticing that Miles isn't the only spider-man that tries to disguise their true voice when talking to family.",neutral
144,"I took my grandboys to see this at their request. It's a very long movie with many plot twists but without a satisfactory ending. The dialogue is rapid-paced and often gets lost in the amplified music and sound effects. It's one of those movies where you say, ""What was that all about?"" once it's over. Perhaps fanboys who love Spiderman will get it. I didn't and neither did my grandkids, one of them saying, ""Are you kidding?"" when the end titles came on. The animation kept the action briskly moving with its dips, swoops and dives. The dialogue was witty in spots as well. But as other critics have said, much could have been cut out of the movie and it would have been fine, perhaps even better.",positive
145,"This is most definitely the movie of the year! The animation, the backgrounds for characters, the fight scenes. All just amazing. It made me really think about how much people in my life mean to me and how much I mean to them. I have absolutely no idea how they were able to top the last one but they did. I'm a bit worried that they won't be able to top the next one though, all doubts set aside, I still think that they have the abilities to pull it off. That's why I am truly excited for the next one. By the way it is coming out at the end of march next year if anyone wanted to know. Hey at least it's not another 5 years like the last one.",positive
146,"I loved the first one. Spoke so highly of it and recommended it to all my friends for how intricate and interesting the plot is. I was looking forward to this new installment but very disappointing that it was a long movie without an ending.Suddenly, in the last 20 minutes, when the energy was going up to a 10, from an 8, and more and more complexity was being introduced.. I knew it. I can't believe they are doing it to animated movies now ('cartoons'). Why is the movie not feeling like I will have the itch scratched. 'to be continued..' .. knew it!!Not cool to do that, especially when they introduced more and more open loops. To do it with animated movies now? Seriously, the money grabbing just never stops.",positive
147,"Best Spider-Man movie ever???, more of like the worst Spider-Man movie i've ever watched, Across The Spider-Verse is indeed fits with the title, it's basically a set up movie for the big finale/battle for the next movie, this movie is just the middle of it, i have so many problem with the film from it being too incredibly long, incredibly slow, and incredibly quiet, i don't know if it's just my theater that the volume of the movie was low but it's just not right, the slowness of the narrative and pacing really bothering me, even the dialogue was so slow that the quiet distance between each line i can hear couple people snoring because how so empty the film is, how boring the movie is, and i'm not blaming them at all, it fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene, the soundtrack was bad and compare to the fire soundtrack of the previous movie there is zero memorable song, the voice acting pissed me off too because how they talk mostly so quitely and so whispery and it also sounds mostly like they have no emotion at all, Across The Spider-Verse is missing a lot of the key part including the OG team with Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker, etc. And i miss the depressed Peter B. Parker and in here he's having a perfect life which is good but not as fun and as engaging of a character anymore, the side villain of this movie was Miguel as Spider-Man 2099 and it didn't work as he was not as cool or as menacing as i expected, so do The Spot unfortunately, the positive was of course the animation was still great, i like both Spider-Man India and Spider-Punk, the action was decent, wasn't really blown away by it, it's quite entertaining, the cameos are fine, but the obvious cameos was very disappointing for me, anyway, Across The Spider-Verse for me was a bad example of a set up movie, a set up movie shouldn't be this long except if you fill it with a boring long narrative that fills with so many unnecessary long slow scene with bland and weak story, weak voice acting, and wrong decisions like this one, Across The Spider-Verse is bad, it's a failure, it's a complete waste of time and it could not be a waste of time if it's execute properly with the runtime, the content, and the story, it could be a less than 2 hours movie of a set up instead of more 30 plus minutes of unnecessary boring content, Into The Spider-Verse was a triumph while Across The Spider-Verse was a blunder, and i have my reason and that's the most important.",negative
148,"This movie was a visual treat, a work of art, and a deep story masterfully told. Although my expectations were already quite high given the beautiful work of the first, this movie exceeded those expectations and even surpasses the original.If you are even remotely considering watching this, do not think about it twice. Go experience this in theaters in all its wonderful imagery and glory. You won't regret this and it may even leave its mark with you. It touches upon so many great themes, including parent/child relationships, fate and individual choice. I cannot say enough about the humanity and brilliance of the heroes, as well as the incredible features and creativity of the villains.A film this great, animated or not, doesn't come around very often. This is truly special.",positive
149,"Absolutely amazing visuals, fantastic story/stories, and incredible characters. There are a quite few stand out spideys that I actually want to see backstories on now.The team that did the visuals for the original massively outdid themselves with this one. Dozens of different art styles across multiple worlds all done fantastically.The voice actors chosen for all the different roles and versions were perfect. Whoever the casting director was nailed it. They knew exactly what they envisioned these characters to be and how they'd sound and they 100% achieved that.I thought I knew where the story was heading and how it was going to end, but, without spoiling anything, I was wrong, or maybe not?Will absolutely rewatch both movies before the next release. Maybe even multiple times.Go watch it... there's a reason it's rated so highly and my summary can't possible do it justice.",positive

and I love action in all forms
never ever before have i seen anything closethis movie is a peace of art, it needs to be seen at least 3 times before you can even get close to seeing and understanding most partsits cinematic is spectacular: to say the least.The story is great, even for grown ups
the characters are extremly well developed
the music is awesomethe pictures: OMG the pictures: OMG
the pace is extremeit is close to a perfect movie, if there is ever one, for 2023for me it will have the same impact as Matrix
there will be a time before and aftersee it in a cinema and enjoy the ride.",positive
151,"These movies are spectacular. I loved the first one and thought there was no way they could make the second one as good. It is as good or even better!! It is engaging and funny. It has such a good plot and storyline. The characters are wonderfully developed. The spot is a really cool villain and the twist at end is wow! Beside all of this, the visuals are phenomenal. It's an experience to watch it. I can't imagine the amount of talent that went into making this movie. I saw this in the movie theater and I cannot wait to rewatch it when it starts streaming. My 7 year old loves it as much as me.",positive
152,"This was a perfect movie to complement ""Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse"". I mean everything from the acting, animation, plot, twist/turns and much more was just astonishing. Complements to everyone but specifically Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld. They both do such an amazing job portraying there characters not inly in the first film but somehow manage to do even better on the second. I love the way both Shameik and Hailee along with the animators fill us in on the gap from the first movie to this one, between the transitions and colors.If you are a Spider-Man fan this is a very great film. The great thing about this movie is if you are a fan of Spider-Man you don't necessarily need to watch the first movie to have this one make sense.",positive
153,"A good movie is something that entertains you at the moment. A great movie is one that stays with you way after the screen turns black. Never have I felt this passionately about a superhero movie before. Every frame was breathtaking. The use of colour to convey each emotion was phenomenal. It was a rollercoaster of emotions with a soundtrack that did not stop amazing me. The humour, the wit, the subtle messaging, I could watch this one a million times. My personal favourite scenes where the one with Gwen and her dad and the one with Gwen and Miles pictured to Monalisa. But the whole movie was remarkable. It truly won my heart.",positive
154,"Loved the original a 10 out of 10 movie, so was really looking forward to this. Again the animation and effects are a visual treat, and replicate the fun/style of the first movie, even improving on this at times. But, and it's a big but, the whole movie is just a bit meh, it doesn't really go anywhere and at times just drags along to its rather abrupt finish. In reality, it's way too flabby and unfocussed, cutting a good 20-25 minutes might help better pace the constant jumping between the plodding and manic flow of the movie and would help bring the main story to the front. The whole thing feels a little bit like it's missed a post production stage, and that they didn't quite get around to the ending...",positive
155,"From All. Not only a Animation with Action, Darkest moments and elements from comedy. This is not classic Animation how in Disney or Pixar with classic 1 hour and 30 minutes with happy ending. Time to change method from making Animation from 2023. Spider-Verse 2's Runtime Is 2 hour with 20 minutes but don't really feel the duration of the movie only Is Action, Humor and Good fun with Spider-Squad. Civil War 2.0 with Ending how on Infinty War. So i had a Good time with Watching Across The Spider-Verse, moments make me a laugh experience. (Chai Tea). Characters Is Very Best but Miguel O'Hara shocked me with His History and Spot Is now my Favorite Villain from Marvel Movies because Is Strongest and Funniest on my opinion. Sony Animation make a The Artwork. I recommend to everyone. #MilesMoralesForever.",positive
156,"The design is even more modern and it looks like a work of art no matter which scene you capture. However, they use too much color and the outlines in the picture are difficult to see.I understand why we don't need 3D glasses. Because, it looks like 3D. But 1, 3D, it just blew my mind. So I can't compere.The story is not better than 1. Overall dark tone, and ends without any significant climactic moments.Also a pregnant woman shouldn't move like that. Too dangerous for both.Even she got kicked off the ride.Maybe, they wanna show woman is strong but It's just a wrong way to show it.I think it can be one 3hours movie if they cut unnessary scenes.When you leave the theater, you have mixed feelings. It's a good movie but it doesn't have the proper ending.Music is not catchy. Because the movie is dark tone.In many ways 2 is greater than 1.But I still love 1 in many ways.Also I got tired of multiverse things.",positive
157,"I admit there were a few scenes that I enjoyed, but overall it was a struggle to finish. The pace of the animation was too much. Felt like a non-stop chase scene for much of the movie. Basically my brain went into standby at times for the visuals while I just listened the words to decipher what was going on. And I'm not old at all , but was just too much. I may be the only one but I'm really struggling to connect to Miles , at times his attitude is a bit much and that chip on his shoulder made me hard to be on his side. I was actually on the side of the bad guy in this one , at least he had a clear purpose.",neutral
158,"Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece. The animation is in a league of its own--utterly brilliant both in concept and execution.This one builds on the foundation laid in Into the Spider-Verse (which is also a masterpiece). The two fit together as one cohesive story.The music is fire. The score by Daniel Pemberton reaches new heights, with his themes being essential to the story. Metro Boomin did a great job with the songs as well (though I preferred Into the Spider-Verse's soundtrack).The voice acting was spot on. The casting choices were brilliant and each one brought depth and emotion to their characters which were brought to life by the best animators in the world.The cinematography and directing were outstanding. The worlds they created and the way they were depicted are a masterclass.Spider-Man fan or not, do yourself a favor and watch this film. It's a beautiful spectacle to behold. Your eyes, ears, and heart will thank you.",positive
159,The visuals storytelling voice acting depth connection to the source material of each character is outstanding the amount of depth they create in subtle ways for even characters with small screen time is crazy and the fact it's part one of two means we get even more of this. This movie is animation at its peak don't miss this one. Or you're missing out on one of the greatest films of our generation and that is coming from an animator. This film transcends the cinema and truly becomes a masterpiece in art and media. If this team keeps it up in part two we are in for something truly special. You will love it.,positive
160,"Seen on June 3, 2023 (most of the review is written based on the Latin dubbing of it, because of that, I'm from Argentina).I saw it at the cinema last weekend, and I can only say one thing, it's beautiful... it's that, god, it's great, like, with the style and quality of the animation Sony keeps surprising me more and more, apart from that, the styles, my god, there's a mixture of so many between the multiverse and the multiple realities of Spidey that it made me a little dizzy, but still, it looks beautiful.Aside from the humor, which I actually found quite funny in certain parts, and aside from another aspect, which is quite criticized, yeah, I'm talking about the dubbing... obviously I reject the idea that most of the dubbing is formed by Startalents from YT, Twitch, Tik Tok and all that, but in my honest opinion, yes, obviously I noticed a certain change, and I disliked some voices, but in itself the dubbing is not bad, it's like it just happened as the movie progressed. I didn't like Juan Guarnizo's voice too much, Pipe Punk's a little bit yes, and I had even read that the youtuber Jugando con Natalia (Juan Manuel Paradiso) had participated in the Latin dubbing, if you can tell me which character he dubbed, I would be very grateful, even being the most attentive, I still can't figure out which character he dubbed his voice to.Besides, I have to admit that I didn't watch ""Into the Spider-Verse"", only several clips, although I still managed to understand the movie and the story.God, when I saw the ending I was left with all the intrigue in the world, and I was like well, let's wait until next year when they release part 2, there's no other way...",positive
161,"This here movie isn't one of those movies when animation is the only good part. This here movie has amazing story, and connects really well to the first movie overall. It seems like all this was planned ahead, and it probably was.I really liked the movie and its characters. We now get a new villain who opposes Miles, with his motives being very clear. He also is a bit comedic in the first half, though he gets taken more seriously later on. It wouldn't be exciting to have an antagonist with no real threat.Gwen Stacy plays a more important role in this movie, which we clearly needed. I'm glad the movie showed a bit more of what she was going with post-Into the Spiderverse. Instead of having a 30 second clip summarising her story, we have a 30 minute beauty telling her storyWe're also introduced to other such as new character, Miguel (Spider-man 2099), Hobbie (Spider Punk), Mumbai's spider-man, and so on. I cannot dive deep into these characters because it would spoil a lot of the movie. Though, I enjoyed that all the different spider-man had their own animation style. This here is something we're going to see time and time again in the next movie.The animation doesn't seem like a can of spray paint painted across, it isn't too fast and you can see what is going on. All you do is sit there and admire the movie and its fantastic animation, it looks and feel like music going through not your ears, but your eyes. Now I get why this here movie was being delayed. The soundtrack is nearly as good, and helps really drive the intensity of much of the scenes. Just take a look, and listen to the soundtrack. I promise to you won't regret it.The only down part is the ending, it makes this movie feel like a too long intro to the next. Also because it hypes you up for the next movie, by having the scene near the ending be so good and exciting.I can't really complain because everything else was done so good.Overall: The Animation, The characters, the story, the Soundtrack, the movie is all executed beautifully. 10/10.",positive
162,"The amount of work put into small details fro
the animators in this is spectacular.The way that Miles is animated at a slower fps when he's still learning to control his powers to the faster fps when he embraces them is a great example of visual story telling.To the way that he moves in the streets of the city listening to his music and putting stickers up while he is in his comfort zone to the duality of when he enters the new school for the first time and is overwhelmed and stumbling overhimself uncomfortable.A really amazing story as well about pushing yourself past your limits and that all it takes is ""a leap of faith"". Further symbolized by Miles pushing away from the mirror and breaking it when he makes his first jump in suit, showing despite him not being ready yet he forces and pushes himself to be.",positive
163,"Trust me when i say this this is my first 10/10 rating animation in films! It exceeded my expectations, honestly i had lower expectation due to not a big fan of any animation film, but this suprises me, looking forward for the sequel.Spiderverse shattered all my preconceived notions about animation films, leaving me awestruck and craving for more. From the very first scene to the final credits, this movie delivered a breathtaking visual experience that was simply unmatched. The attention to detail, vibrant colors, and innovative animation techniques made every frame a work of art.What truly set Spiderverse apart was its unique storyline and compelling characters. The film brilliantly introduced us to a multiverse of Spider-Men and Spider-Women, each with their own distinct personality and backstory. It was a joy to witness the diverse cast of characters coming together, forming an unlikely team of heroes who were relatable and deeply human.",neutral
164,"I'm one of the few on here I see that wasn't just blown away by this film. Like the first, the visuals and comic style look absolutely amazing! However, it seemed like this story when no action was on screen lagged on for about an hour too long. There were more than one occasion if the story had wrapped up I would have been satisfied. But then a new story line would emerge that really didn't add anything to anything. I understand that there were a lot of new characters to introduce and the writers felt the need to explain the multiverse and cannon timeline. But it got redundant to me.I would have been perfectly fine after sitting there for 2 1/2 hours if they had just wrapped it up. But I guess I'll have to wait til part 2.Visuals: 10/10
Soundtrack: 9/10
Story: 6/10Overall grade: B+",positive
165,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" swings into action with a dazzling display of animation and a heartwarming multiverse story. It's a spectacular sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it. The visuals are mind-bending, showcasing the potential of animation in storytelling. The characters remain endearing, and the introduction of new Spider-People adds depth to the narrative. The humor is sharp, and the action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking. The film strikes a perfect balance between lighthearted moments and emotional depth. It's a cinematic achievement that leaves you eagerly anticipating the next installment in this spectacular Spider-Verse saga.",neutral
166,"Critics and general audiences are comparing this to The Dark Knight and saying that it's not just one of the greatest animated movies ever made, it's the best comic book movie EVER. I respectfully disagree with those statements. Having watched it last night, and as not only a huge Spidey fan but someone who loved Into the Spider-Verse enough to put it on my Top 10 Favorite Movies of 2018, I have been looking forward to this follow-up for years now.First, the good: the animation is as good (and in some ways even better) than Into the Spider-Verse. It's like a beautiful painting unlike any other art style out there...even Pixar. Characters like Miles and Gwen get a deeper, richer treatment, with some extremely satisfying development, and the voice acting is convincing. In fact, my favorite scene was one that integrated the characters creatively with the artistic choices.So why didn't I give this a higher rating? Because the plot is too often buried underneath fan service and Easter eggs that honestly will only be understood by hardcore Spider-Man fans. Especially once our heroes go into the Multiverse filled with hundreds upon THOUSANDS of various Spider-Men, Women, etc., it becomes too busy and flashy for its own good! I feel that it's only decent to warn you: even if you DON'T have headaches or seizures, this movie might just induce one! A coherent plot is necessary for a movie that is not only the second chapter in a trilogy, but the first of a two-parter. Throughout the TWO HOURS AND 16 MINUTE runtime, you are constantly bombarded with all the stuff I just mentioned, and I felt exhausted by the end. Why do blockbusters, especially two-parters, feel the need to become longer and longer these days? I could excuse some of the older movies, made decades ago, for being 3 and a half or even four hours if they earned it. But just consider this: Into the Spider-Verse was almost 20 minutes shorter than this one, and while I understand that sequels tend to go bigger and bolder, they NEED to justify the runtime. Unlike Infinity War (which was longer by 20 minutes), I didn't walk out feeling any real urgency to see the next movie.So did Across the Spider-Verse make me laugh, smile, and even occasionally give me the feels? Yes, but it proved to be WAY too much of a good thing. And it could have been great. I went in not only wanting to like it, but LOVE it maybe.P. S. There are no post-credits scenes, so no need to stay when the movie ends unless you are in love with the animation.",positive
167,"Into the Spider-Verse was one of the rare big studio movies that felt fresh, authentic and full of heart. Across the Spider-Verse falls short of matching its predecessor in each of those counts.Whenever a superhero movie succeeds, big studios try to distill its essence down to a formula, trim out any creative risks to make it safe for large-scale public consumption and add some fanservice. This is the case with the second instalment of Spider-verse.Except for the art. The art was brilliant and original. But little else stays with you after after the end.On a side note, is anyone else tired of multiverses? In the first movie, spider-beings from different dimensions were fresh and funny. Twenty popular movies and series later, it feels played out. The central plot feels like something out of an old Rick and Morty episode.But the bigger problem was this: the essence of Spider Man stories is that he is both a teenager and a superhero. He has typical teenager problems, struggles to juggle his double life, makes mistakes and learns from them. The first half of the movie followed that template and was good fun to watch.But then the movie turns it upside down and the teens become smarter than the adults. The adult Spider folks in Spider HQ(which was basically Citadel of Ricks from R&M) not only approach a sensitive conversation with Miles with the delicacy of a sledgehammer, it's unclear if they even know what they are talking about.The centrepiece of the movie is an extended chase scene with little suspense about the result. Here's another thing that annoys me: making your hero suddenly overpowered by having them beat other characters in a way that defies in-universe logic.The English punk spiderman made me chuckle though.",positive
168,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Everything about the movie works. The beginning with Gwen Stacy was executed perfectly, the re-introduction to Miles and the introduction of Spot was handled well.Admittedly the first half, while amazing, isn't perfect, but luckily the second half of the movie starts when Miles jumps into a multiverse portal and lands in India. From now until the end, the movie is a 12/10. Everything after Miles jumps into the portal is perfect.And I haven't even mentioned the music yet. Daniel Pemberton made one of the best movie soundtracks of all time and Metro also made a great album with it.I would keep going but I would never stop. So all you need to know is this is a 10/10 masterpiece you should watch as soon as possible.",positive
169,"Wow just wow! This movie better win many awards. It's clever, has a good story not to mention the most unique cinematic story ever made! Everyone should see this weather you like the Spider-Man franchise and with or without kids. Run don't walk. Prepare to have your mind blown! The script is funny, serious and soooo clever! The emotion in this ""cartoon"" (which I feel like it may be offensive to call it that) is superb! My husband and I kept looking at each other in the movie over the kids like whoa! Wow! That's so cool! How did even think about this! Also to add the soundtrack is perfect as well! An all around amazing movie!",positive
170,"Following 2018's Into the Spiderverse movie, this sequel was eagerly anticipated by all who had seen the first due to its groundbreaking use of multiple animation styles and clever cinematography which had been little used in the history of animation before. This new slice into Brooklyn spider-man Miles Morales' life did not disappoint.Following his previous explorations into the multiverse (an idea which has now shaped the following phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe), the film follows Miles' life as he juggles being spider-man with his classes. This sounds like your typical teenage superhero film so far. Alongside his reality, his friend and fellow spiderperson Gwen Stacy's life is also documented in more detail than we had seen in the previous film, explaining the meaning behind her loneliness and need to be the best spider-woman. In the opening of the film, Gwen is conducted into a multiversal group of spiderpeople from every dimension to investigate new threats on the multiverse.The main highlights of the film were definitely the moments of exploring the many multiverses, where the filmmakers had really stretched the boundaries of what an animated superhero film should be. We saw British rock spider-man who's animation style was reflective of collage, Lego spiderman through brick animation, squish mallow spider man and best of all this multiverse of spiderpeople finally allowed clips from the live action films of spider-man to play. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's incarnations of spider-man were represented on screen along with real life cameos from a minor antagonist in Tom Holland's Spiderman Homecoming. A feast for the eyes.I barely have any criticisms, the to be continued ending was frustrating but overall much better than attempting to solve a complex plot twist in 20 minutes. If anything, it compels me to follow everything about and around the third film - Beyond the Spiderverse set to be released in 2024.I will happily watch this film many times and keep finding new animated details and cameos the 200 animators have hidden in every scene every time I watch it. 10 stars for such incredible visuals, cohesive and steady plot, unforced and witty humour, an incredible soundtrack and score and just overall greatness. I didn't think it was possible to top the first film, but they have by bringing the principles of the first film which made it so groundbreaking but hightening and pushing them even further.",positive
171,"That 5 year long wait was worth it! Just like with the first movie it's going to take a long time to fully process what I just watched. But I couldn't be happier right now. Across the Spider-Verse is everything I wanted in a Spider-Man movie and is the perfect sequel. Most importantly even with all the spider characters/cameos this is still Miles' movie. That ending?!?! We're really about to get one of the best trilogies ever.Special thank you to all the artists that contributed to this movie. I don't know how they do it, but visually Across the Spider-Verse is on another level. There are so many shots that blew my mind. I can't wait to break down this movie frame by frame. This is just the beginning. I know this movie is going to consume my life for the next couple of years.",positive

173,"After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales (Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.",neutral
174,"At long last we have our sequel to Into The Spiderverse. One thing I'll point out is the astonishing animation/visual effects. Truly a work of art. The way each Spiderperson had their own unique style continues to be a highlight of this franchise. It was really cool to see all the different variations of Spider-Man all in one movie. With that being said the script was a little misguided, and really failed to tell a solid story in one movie. The focus of this movie is fractured, and we as an audience are along for the ride. Definitely feels like an extended 2nd act. I've aways said a movie should be more than sequel bait, and I feel the writers stretched this story to get one more movie out of it. While it'll be an epic binge in the future, I don't see myself rewatching this one until the Spiderverse trilogy is complete.",neutral
175,"The plot is so tight, the animation is absolutely insane, I honestly have never seen a more incredible looking movie. On a technical and visual level, this film incorporates literally every style of animation and cinematography that is available. It is jaw dropping what has been achieved in this movie. The characters are brilliant, with perfectly selected voice actors to match.SONY really have achieved something unique here, and the animators should each be given their own award for the level of skill and attention to detail in this film.I have superhero fatigue and am tired of Multiverse plots. But all that goes out of the window, just for this film.A visual masterpiece. True art.",positive
176,"I loved the first one and was so ready to love this one too. But within the first half hour, my hope for this sequel was waning.The opening set up with Gwen took entirely too long. I was so ready to get back to Miles.But then when we got back to Miles, there was another dreadfully long section of not so dramatic family drama. It just really didn't have enough stakes and was dragged out for far too long.I enjoyed the villain but echo what others have said - he doesn't have anywhere near an interesting enough back story to carry not just 1, but 2 films.Once we got into the Spider-Man Citadel, it just kind of felt like an episode of Rick and Morty but with the length and snooze factor of Apocalypse Now. And finally, FINALLY, after what felt like eons, they reintroduced us to the Peter Parker we got to fall in love with in the first film.By the final stretch of the film, I was really wondering how (and when) they were going to wrap this up. My annoyance at the cliffhanger was only trumped by my joy that this drag of a movie was finally finished.This is movie that didn't need to be half as long as this runtime, and which missed some fundamental understanding of what made the first one so great. I really hope the final one has some tighter writing.I also want to clarify - I don't have a problem with long movies. In fact, I love them! Most of my favourite movies have 2hour plus runtimes. Problems only arise when it FEELS like a movie has a 2hour plus runtime, and Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse felt loooooooooooonnnnngggg...",positive
177,"Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse dates back to 2018. The film was received extremely positively by friend and foe and rightly so. And such an animated film with a sublime animation style was something that had never been seen before on this scale. Like going to a comic book that was translated on screen and with a very, very good story. It may take five years for the sequel, but patience pays off and how. It seemed a fairly tough task in advance to be able to surpass Into the Spider-Verse, but this has absolutely succeeded in every area. Where the regular Marvel movies have fallen into disrepair, where the quality of those movies has gone up and down, the Spider-Verse movies are definitely not and maybe it's better for Marvel to focus on these gems than again for the umpteenth time to bring some weak and much too expensive live action film into the cinemas that are destroyed by the media and the public.The story is enriched by deepening the backgrounds of, for example, Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales and that really works out perfectly. Why mention Gwen first? That's simple, the story around Gwen really worked out best in this movie. The opening of the movie might make you think ok, I hope it really gets a lot better than this, but this feeling will go away very soon. The origin of Spider-Man's enemy Spot is beautifully worked out. At first it seems like a funny and above all clumsy figure who has absolutely no control over his powers. When it finally becomes clear who Spot is and what his ultimate intentions are, Gwen comes back into the picture with Miles, but it is not yet clear why. Until Miles finds out that all universes are connected and that Gwen turns out to be a key that brings Miles to the Spider-people, led by Miguel O'Hara. This all sounds very dull, but the story seems to have a really hypnotic effect and that is where the strength of the film lies.With a running time of almost two and a half hours, it might stop people from taking a quick look at the film, but the running time is justified. Where Into the Spider-Verse still felt like the best, which strangely enough was still kept under two hours, that is really different with this film. With Into the Spider-Verse it was in a chaotic and almost impossible to follow color explosion called the ending. This is really different in Across the Spider-Verse. The entire film is expertly worked out, with the story only leaving you wanting more. Obviously this is because the open ending is just a cutoff in the middle of the story, but that's not the only thing. The coming together of every Spider-Man in history and more also builds up to more than just confronting Spot. Of course we could dedicate an entire review to how beautiful the animation is, but this was of course already very clear after the first part. The different animation styles are mixed in this film with a number of other surprises that not only bring you to the drawn or animated Spider-Man, but much more.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse surpasses its predecessor in every way and raises the bar for a sequel. Not only the animation is fantastic, but also the story is perfectly worked out. Perhaps with Across the Spider-Verse we had the best Spider-Man movie yet and that really promises something for the sequel. It is especially the depths of Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales that add considerable force to the film. The threat coming from enemy Spot is really good and the part where Miles joins the Spider-people is really well done. The playing time of almost two and a half hours is strangely enough still a bit on the short side, but good. That is not surprising in this case, because the film ends in the middle of the story, so there is still plenty to do. The movie has been in theaters for a while and for those who haven't seen the movie in theaters yet, do yourself a favor and just go there.",positive
178,"They somehow managed to top almost every aspect of the first film. An extraordinary display of what animation is capable of. They're just showing off at this point...I guess the one thing that's worse than the first film is the plot. However, unlike the first one, Across the Spider-Verse exists to create a grand setup for the final film, and boy, it does that really well. Still can't beat the personal journey of Miles in the first movie though.Plus Daniel Pemberton's music is as good as ever. Each one of his themes used in the first film are thrown into overdrive here, and the brand new themes he introduces aren't too shabby.",positive
179,"I want to have this movie in my home, right now. So I can watch it a few more times. As I watched in the cinema, I got emotional of how beautiful this movie is. Everytime Gwen's storyline came up, I got goosebumps. The backgrounds fits every character perfectly. It's freaking funny, it's good for nerds and non-nerds, there's a lot of depth and emotion in it. Various life stages are touched in this movie. From teenager to parent. From puppy love to hardcore grief.When the movie ended the audience sighed. Nooo we want moooore. And I will wait patiently for more of this beautiful artpiece. If the third one is half as good as this one, it's still the best series in the history of film.",positive
180,"I had high hopes for this film and it did not disappoint. I don't know if anyone else has felt this but recently, movies have not seemed AMAZING to me. I usually sit in the movie wondering how long is left because it starts getting boring. I think if I remember correctly, the last AMAZING movie I watched was Avengers: Endgame. But now it's this. Even while having extremely high hopes, this movie still went above and beyond. The artwork, the music, the story line, everything was amazing. When it ended I was just surprised how fast the time had passed and I was left wanting for more. Every little easter egg, every little detail, everything was awesome. I cannot put into words how much this movie left me shocked. It is impossible to say. Whoever has yet not seen this movie, I would like to say one thing, GO WATCH IT NOW!!!! FORGET EVERYTHING AND WATCH IT!!!! IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!",neutral
181,"A complete pack of plot twists, humor, emotions, action, and amazing characters. Everything about this movie is just great. The animations, as usual, are mind-blowing and, I think, better than the first Spider Verse movie. The movie ends with the perfect cliffhanger. Even if you haven't watched any of the other Marvel movies, this one would blow your mind. However, having some knowledge about the MCU and knowing what happened in the first movie would help enhance the experience, as the other spiderman movies, starting from Tobey Maguire to Tom Holland, just gives one a perspective of the big picture and how everything connects. After Endgame, Marvel movies started going downhill and most fans, including myself, don't like it as much as the movies before. This movie, although not part of the actual MCU, has reignited my interest for Marvel movies and I am sure the next movie would be the same.",positive
182,"Stunning visualsExtremley funnyGreat plotGreat charactersCan't wait for the next one!Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. Every second of this movie is hilarious, captivating, has stunning visuals and is key to the plot. Every little detail in this movie all connects together. Absolutely no screen time wasted, the movie did not drag for a second. The characters are some of the best ever. The voice acting is perfect to say the least. Every frame of this 2 hour movie is a beautifully crafted piece of art. Sony you have blown me away, easily the best movie of the 2020's so far definitely an all time classic must see. 11/10.",positive
183,"This is one of the best productions ever made about Spider-Man, no doubt about it. It's the kind of movie that changes your perspective on life, provoking reflections as much as it entertains you. Miles Morales returns in this sequel facing dilemmas that we can easily relate to in real life. I find it exceptional that the production is building a story with such emotional depth, which, by the way, is already a characteristic of Spider-Man. Moreover, the audio-visual production is extremely coherent with the source material and the characters in every shot, with a lot of representation and immersion. I can confidently say that the visual art in this film is breathtaking, it never falls short at any moment. Worthy of an Oscar!",positive
184,"Across the Spiderverse is a solid movie. While it doesn't quite capture the charm of the original, it definitely isn't a disappointing sequel either.Take everything that made Into the Spiderverse absolutely excellent, tone it down a bit, and you're left with Across the Spiderverse. Still a good movie, but nowhere near as profound and heartfelt as the first.As usual with Marvel and Marvel-partnered movies, the storyline and base premises could use some work. The ""if X does(n't) happen, the multiverse ends"" type plotlines are tired and tedious by now. This often deadens the stakes for media because of how cliche and unrelatable it is.The humor is solid, but they did ramp up the Marvel-tier, 4th wall breaking humor compared to the first movie.The main characters are definitely still solid, but I found the two main antagonists to be lacking. There were still some good sequences of tension and drama between the lead characters.For a couple side characters, luckily they didn't harp on the pregnancy bit or the child/infant bit, which I was really worried from the trailers.The plot often moves extremely quickly, leaving very little time for the characters to breathe. There were a few key moments that really could have used a bit more space. Nothing too major though.The art style is still very unique and fun, however, this film felt a bit less like a comic book come to life than the first. They definitely left out a few elements and flairs in this one that made it feel less like a comic book. Each universe visited has its own unique artstyle, but some made a few strange artistic choices. Namely, some scenes would randomly switch lighting and color palettes multiple times during the sequence for seemingly no reason. It seemed like they were just shot-gunning styles for no reason. There was only one scene where the background change made sense (big character moment).There's one solid musical sequence, but if you're looking for the same fun musical journey found in the first film, you really won't find it here.The diversity among the characters was nice to see, and didn't feel forced. Every character, for the most part, has their own natural motivations, and doesn't really do anything ""because the plot told them to.""That being said, there were a couple parts where it just felt like a cameo-fest with the whole multiverse peddling, but that's just typical Marvel fanservice. *yawn*The action sequences are good fun, but could have definitely used better film blocking and staging. You will often not have a good idea of where things are in relation to one another. This unfortunately turns some of the sequences into arbitrary ""rock'em sock'em! Cool shots n' cool poses!"" rather than a more fleshed out choreography.The first film left you with mental images of stunning cinematography, compositions, and camera movements. While the cinematography of this film was ""solid"" it really did not really leave me with any profound imagery that stuck in mind.Overall, Across the Spiderverse is a decent sequel that falls short of the original's charm and depth. The humor and main characters are solid, but the antagonists and core plot are somewhat lacking. The fast-paced plot leaves little room to soak in the moments that needed soaking in, and some of the artistic choices felt arbitrary and inconsistent. Overall, it's a good movie but not as excellent as its predecessor. It did not leave me feeling inspired to rewatch it any time soon like the original did.",positive
185,"I was a HUGE fan of the first movie. I went into it expecting the multiple spider-people to be confusing and overwhelming and left the theatre a new person. I bought the art book. I studied the style. I wrote about this franchise in my college application essays.And to now see that the animation has only improved just blows me away. I see how the filmmakers adapted the praise and excitement about the animation and colors and cranked it up; this movie is somehow more beautiful than the last. The comedy is excellent. The soundtrack is engaging and creative. The cast of characters and background spider-people only drive the point further that anyone can be spider-man with the level of diversity among them. The writing and dialogue is just amazing, the cast is wonderful, and the conflict feels real and devastating.The only real negatives I can think of are that it was kind of a lot/messy, and it sucks that this movie was split into two; that makes it feel like the story was only just getting started before it suddenly stopped.This film truly shows what animation is capable of. All the elements come together so well.And lastly, I'm Indian. So seeing Pavitr Prabhakar on the big screen not only representing the Indian community, but also our culture in a way that was fun and relatable made me so happy. I understand that the movie serves more of a base-level view on Indian culture but seeing as the movie isn't really about that, I think they did a good job, especially with the entire Mumbattan environment. I loved every second of it. People don't realize how much representation matters. I'm grateful.",positive
186,"This sequel kinda felt unneeded. The first movie just felt like a brand new and innovative entry into the Spider-Man franchise with its amazing animation and original storytelling while this movie just felt like it was milking the franchise, and not actually a necessary sequel to make.It has pretty awesome animation like the first one, but you could easily enjoy the first movie without needing to watch this sequel because the first one ended without any cliffhanger, and could easily be seen as a stand alone movie while this movie was over 2 hours long and ended with a cliffhanger. In terms of ideas, technological and graphical effects the first movie had, I don't think this movie added anything new compared with the first one besides adding a bunch of unnecessary new characters. This movie just felt boring, unoriginal and messy with all the spider-verse stuff. The first one had several different interesting villains, which was one of the things that made it so good, while this one only had spot, who really didn't make the movie that good.The Miles Morales story from the first movie felt like it was complete and didn't need any sequel. Instead of having the same main character in this movie, they should've just switched the main character and added a brand new and original story.There's also one side of Gwen's haircut, which is still bald, even though the movie takes place months after the first movie. Some scenes have real life people in them. The entire movie should've been animated.",positive
187,"Remember when people were able to tell a story in two hours or less? When stories had a beginning, middle and an end? When the number one priority wasn't to build a never ending franchise, but to simply tell a story?I liked Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) which I thought was surprisingly good.Please, give the whole multiverse schtick a rest. Sure, it offers the great (merchandising) opportunity to include a zillion versions of Spiderman, but it also reduces the stakes to absolutely nothing.In the first half of the movie they establish the new main bad guy (or so one would think) whose backstory is a ridiculous throwaway gag by one of the animators of the first movie. After an hour or so the new bad guy vanishes from the movie. As we get closer to the end I look at my watch thinking ""There's no way they'll wrap this up in the ten minutes that are left"". And of course they don't, since their priority isn't to tell a coherent story, but to build a franchise. So we're left hanging with no resolution. If we want one, we'll have to pay for the next movie too! Genius film making.Of course it was 20-30 minutes too long as per usual for comic book movies today. And this is only the first installment! Including the sequel (or rather, the third act of this movie) this simple story will probably be about an hour longer than Gone With The Wind. Amazing.I watched this movie on a huge screen in Tokyo. The visuals were grating. The dotted areas and the double/triple outlines, which I suppose are meant to emulate early printing techniques of shadows/gradients and out-of-focus areas did not look good on the big screen. The first movie employed the same visual style, although not as pronounced as in this sequel. On a small screen (like my 65 inch OLED at home) they were not an issue. But on a huge cinema screen they were making my eyes bleed.There is no way I'll pay to see the third one.",positive
188,"I loved Into the Spider Verse, I seriously have no words to describe how spectacular Across the Spider Verse was! Somehow they managed to make the second movie better than the first!Every frame of the movie is basically a work of art. It can easily be put into an art museum. I also love how they were able to put different types of animation as well, from LEGO to non-cartoon, to comic-book.The acting is also amazing, Hailee Steinfeld actually has a bigger role in the movie and I'm so thankful that Gwen Stacy was given the emotional backstory we all wanted. The actor that plays the villain Spot is also really clever as well, but the real star of the movie is Oscar Issac. I loved his character the most, he plays his role with such passion that I've never seen from any actor. Honestly everyone did a great job at playing their roles, those three were the highlights. It wasn't like Quantamania where the acting was carried by Jonathan Majors only and the rest were really annoying.Overall, a must watch for anyone. The Spider Verse movies are meant to be directed towards kids, but honestly adults will love.",positive
189,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning animated film that brings together multiple Spider-people from different dimensions. The film is a continuation of the first Spider-Verse movie, and it certainly delivers on the hype. From the opening scene, the film immerses its audience in a vibrant and colorful multiverse where anything is possible.The animation is one of the best things about the film. It's a mix of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer-generated graphics, creating an eye-catching visual style that perfectly captures the comic book feel of the Spider-Man universe. The attention to detail in the animation also extends to the character design and the backgrounds, making every scene a feast for the eyes.The voice cast is also top-notch. Shameik Moore returns as Miles Morales, and Jake Johnson reprises his role as Peter B. Parker. New additions include Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Gwen, and other talented actors who bring their unique flair to their respective Spider-characters.Aside from the animation and the story, the soundtrack is another highlight of the film. The score by Daniel Pemberton is a thrilling and exciting mix of orchestral and electronic music that perfectly complements the action-packed scenes. The film also features a variety of popular songs, from Post Malone's ""Sunflower"" to Lil Nas X's ""Montero,"" adding another layer to the film's already impressive audiovisual experience.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is simply one of the best animated films ever made. It's a thrilling and action-packed adventure that delivers on all fronts, from the animation to the story, the voice acting, and the music. It's a movie that will appeal to both long-time Spider fans and newcomers to the franchise. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and swing into the Spider-Verse.",positive
190,"I am a huge fan of everything Spider-Man, but this film takes the cake. Incredible animation, genuine creativity and so much heart! My three children, my wife and I were on the edge of our seats throughout the entire movie.If you go and see any movie this year, this is the one to see.In todays world we need a film we can all rally behind, this is one of those films.To the Screenwriters, the Director, the Voice actors, the Animators and all of those involved at Sony and Marvel well done! If Spider-Man in to the Spider-verse doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Animated Picture I would be shocked.",positive
191,"FANTASTIC. Now this is how you make a movie. My review can't possibly put into words how amazing this was but I'll try.Animation-wise, I wholeheartedly believe this movie is one of the best in the game, atleast top 5. Incredibly visually stunning; and even if you end up somehow disliking what you saw, atleast you'll know you got some great eye candy. Whatever the animators got paid, they deserved 10x that. They have most definitely paved the way for a new era of animation, and I applaud them for that.The music in this movie really fits well with ALL the scenes, and never does it ever feel lacking. Imo, the music to a movie is much more important than most think, and SMATSV nailed it right on the head.Now, moving onto plot, characters, flow, ect. It's amazing. No other words. I cannot do it justice. It was very humorous, and not once in the movie did I feel bored. The dialogue feels so natural, and so do the movements of characters. Not to mention the plethora of easter eggs to keep you occupied.",positive
192,"Wow! This movie amazed me. I didn't know how good it would actually be, since it is a sequel, but holy! I was blown away. The storyline is great and the music is incredible! Whenever this comes out on TV for cheaper im definitely going to watch it again. The tiny details, the new characters, the Spider-Society... just made me love the movie even more. I am so incredibly lucky I got to watch this in theaters because man... it's just awesome. If you seen it you know what I mean! This was a 10/10 for me. I can't wait to see what Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse has in store for us! I hope you agree :)",positive
193,"This movie gets better every time you scan each you've see it. Amazing frames. Animation is on another level this is indeed the Avatar among animation movie with more exciting story. Kudos to the production team there are about 280 spider people appearing connecting this movie to every spider-man movies, shows and comics ever made lot of cameos unexpectedly. The story goes very well under all this rush of spider people. Every character introduced is amazing the voice over is also exquisite. Another amazing part of the movie is representing individuality of each spider people especially Miles and Gwen is amazing. The villain initially shown as joke goes through amazing character developments. It also has poetic ending leaving us impatient to see the next part.",positive
194,"Into the spider-verse is my favourite Spider-Man movie and in fact my favourite animated movie. Obviously it's been a long wait for the sequel and I had high expectations. This one felt very long, especially as it is only half a story. The film ends on a cliffhanger and felt totally unresolved, it also felt unexpected and abrupt. I also struggled a bit with the animation, where each character was animated in a different style it often felt very chaotic and a bit messy and at times was almost blurry, parts looked like watching a 3D movie without the glasses. I look forward to the next instalment and the plot being resolved, maybe I will feel differently then.",neutral
195,"At the beginning since they announced that they were making a sequel to Spider-Verse I was scared, I was scared thinking about how it will overcome the first chapter since they unveiled us the first teaser trailer which will be titled Across the Spider-verse and then reveal us lots of stuff with the new trailers and New TV Spots showing many cameos of Spider-Man & the Multiverse with full of fan-service and references to then leave plot holes & meaningless script but it wasn't like this this movie is crazy cool. The story maintains again, the characters are done well, the animation and spectacular a Villain that was previously very scarce and then became a threatening but dangerous creep & and even the multiverse was managed well without leaving plot holes. Across the Spider-Verse is a marvel in which I nominated it among my best animated films of 2023. I can't wait for the third part to conclude this Spider Verse trilogy.",positive
196,"Story: 8.5The story was kind of going all over the place at first but slowly connecting with one another down the line. It was very detailed with alot of meanings and purpose in the different scenes of the movie.Characters: 8Alot of new characters in this movie except most of them
were lacking in quality except for a few newly introduced characters and the characters from the first movie.Visuals/Music: 10I mean do I really have to say anything. The song selections were fantastic and really matched the atmosphere of the scenes in the movie and the visuals were so dynamic and powerful to capture different imagery and depth. The visuals and song selections were simply top tier.Overall quite an enjoyable movie.Memorable: Sort of, Rewatchable: Maybe.",positive
197,"I'm on the fence about it. Split into two scores. One is very, very high: the music score and soundtrack. Amazing! 10 out of 10 for me. The other score is weak: the movie itself. I find the story , direction, animation and the voices very mediocre. For children mostly. The script is very predictable, yet confusing at the same time. The amazing music score kept my attention till the end, were it not for the music I suspect I'd be bored. I'm not a fan of comics in general and I'm not a child. Only 2 out of 10 for me. So, I add the score of 10 and the score of 2, and divide it in half. I give the movie 6 stars.",positive
198,"Couldn't get into this one. It drags and meanders and maybe I'm just getting old but visually everything seems choppy, flashing and hard to follow. The story seems a over the place as well with far too many characters with stories going on, which seems to be how Marvel is going with the last few of their films I've seen. The sassy, i-know-more-than-you attitude of the female characters also gets a little tedious after awhile. I guess thr main thing is, I don't follow also why they had to retell Spiderman and not just roll out a new character, since this feels like a completely different character in a completely different universe. Well, whatever.",negative
199,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the realm of animation, pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling to new heights. It is undeniably the best animation the world has witnessed, a true work of art that captivates audiences and leaves them in awe. From the moment the opening scene unfolds, it becomes evident that this film is a game-changer, redefining what is possible within the medium.The first installment of the Spider-Verse franchise, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" stunned audiences with its innovative animation style and engaging narrative. However, the sequel, ""Across the Spider-Verse,"" takes everything to a whole new level. The animation team has crafted a breathtaking tapestry of colors, shapes, and textures that seamlessly blend together, creating a visual feast for the eyes.Every frame of this film is meticulously crafted, filled with intricate details and vibrant hues that bring the story to life. The animation style is a harmonious fusion of traditional 2D animation, comic book aesthetics, and cutting-edge digital techniques. The result is a visual symphony that celebrates the comic book origins of Spider-Man while pushing the medium forward with its groundbreaking approach.The narrative itself is equally compelling. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" takes us on an exhilarating journey as we follow Miles Morales, the Afro-Latino Spider-Man, across multiple dimensions. The storyline effortlessly blends heartwarming moments of self-discovery with high-octane action sequences. It delves deep into the character's growth and explores themes of identity, heroism, and the bonds that unite us across different realities.The voice cast delivers exceptional performances, breathing life into the diverse array of characters. Shameik Moore's portrayal of Miles Morales captures the essence of the character's youthful exuberance, vulnerability, and determination. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, and the dialogue is sharp, humorous, and heartfelt, adding an extra layer of depth to the already remarkable storytelling.What truly sets ""Across the Spider-Verse"" apart, however, is its commitment to innovation. The film takes bold creative risks, embracing unconventional narrative structures and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved in animation. It blurs the lines between dimensions, time, and art forms, creating an immersive experience that is impossible to replicate elsewhere.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an unparalleled masterpiece of animation. It is a testament to the boundless creativity and technical prowess of its creators. From the awe-inspiring visuals to the compelling narrative, every aspect of this film is a testament to the extraordinary talent involved. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse solidifies its place in the annals of animation history and cements its position as the greatest animated work on planet Earth. It is a must-watch for both animation enthusiasts and fans of the Spider-Man mythos, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll.",positive
200,"While in 2023 there aren't really well movies out there. With the really bad outcome of 'The Flash'. This movie gave me chills, the way how it ended gave flashbacks to the time when MCU used to make great movies. The really good portrayal of characters inspite of having so many characters, some other might just ruin it by just changing the whole back story and behavior of the character. The voice overs by the voice actors is also really great, the best one according to me would be the voice of Indian spiderman. The quote of ""Chai tea"" added the humor in a very great way without changing the focus of the movie. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched so far.",positive
201,"It's been a few days since I watched the movie, I had to wait to make sure it wasn't just a temporary love at the moving pictures I just witnessed. But even after these last few days I'm obsessed with how incredible this movie was, and it's PG so it can impact even more audiences with it's relatable conflicts. The art styles and effects from the first move were already great but this stepped it up big-time, with new styles used specifically just for certain characters or their universes and the colors and art matching with emotions, it amazed me. Then on top of that the storytelling was greatly improved, with Gwen's story taking a bigger role but not overpowering Miles's, and other characters getting the just enough explanation and context for the viewer to feel like they know them.",positive
202,"The most incredible movie of the year that is for sure. The most breath taking animation of spiderman. Animation, music, story are absolutely perfect thank you so much for honoring the true legend of spiderman.It is great to watch that nothing seems ackward, everthing falls into place as the story unravels. Spiderman is about doing right, perseverance, humor, frienship, and getting up over and over again after falling or crashing down. Also is about honor, family and understanding that not being perfect only means that you can try harder.This is the movie that makes you feel astonished, grateful to witness art and the essence of comiic.",positive
203,"15/10!!!! Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece not just for superhero movies and animated movies, but cinema itself!! The Empire Strikes Back meets The Dark Knight of animated sequels!! The story is more dramatic and emotional than I thought. The animation is beautiful, mixing all sorts of animation styles like computer animated, hand drawn, comic book, etc. The voice acting is stellar, especially Shamiek Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, and Oscar Isacc!!! My favorite superhero movie I've seen in a long time. Dear Academy, don't just give this the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but also a nomination for Best Picture!!!! Go see this immediately!!!!",positive
204,"When Into the Spider-Verse first came out I enjoyed it but not as much as everyone else, now this movie is a totally different story as it had me hooked the whole time and was such a huge step up from the first movie imo. Can't wait for the finale, and I don't mind how long they take to make it because it deserves it.I love how we started with Gwen and got a better glimpse into her universe and I've got to say how great the art style is and how it changes based on what she's going through.As someone who is big on live action and rate the MCU Spider-Man movies highly, this easily beats them all and takes the cake. I honestly can't wait to pick this up on disc to watch again because it was one of those movies that when your enjoying it all too well, it goes so fast.",positive

In addition, the direction is superb, with breathtaking cinematography that does justice to the spectacular scenery and landscapes in which the characters move. Finally, the music is good. I recommend everyone to see this film, as it is an experience not to be missed and you will certainly appreciate it much more than one might expect"".",positive
206,"When I first watched and reviewed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", it ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 Movies of All Time. It now sits at #67 as I write this. At the time, I thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters. Regarding the story however, it wasn't particularly new or innovative. How many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? This one, if I can make a timely comparison, might have been titled ""Spider-Man: Everything, Everywhere, All at Once"". That comes with the territory of taking place in a multiverse, where just about anyone and anything goes. It's just a little bit too much in my estimation, making the story somewhat confusing and disjointed, perhaps perfect for the attention deficit generation, but unappealing to someone my age who grew up on the very early Spider-Man stories. There's some nod to that era, with a brief glance of an 'Amazing Fantasy #15' comic book cover, along with various other covers appearing in too rapid succession to focus on their relevance. Another turn off for me was the clich√©d dialog that took place throughout the story, with phrases like 'been there, done that', 'wait, what?', and the ever-popular turn of phrase, 'are you serious, right now'. It all made for a direct appeal to an under twenty-five-year-old audience, nothing wrong with that, but with limited appeal to someone who's outgrown their teen years. At present, the movie ranks #22 on IMDb's Top 250. I think it hit as high as #11 when I was following it when it came out. That's higher than its predecessor, and will probably remain that way as both progress down the chart over time. The fact that it was not a done in one film was also a mild annoyance, particularly since it didn't recommend to me that I had to catch the next installment, considering the disorderly course of this one.",positive
207,Much like the last one just perfect along with animation once again from animated to comic style then black and white to live action and a great way of story telling by using the last film from using a bagle to create a powerful/goofy villian like the spot. Then the charcters Gwen stacey was very intresting to get to know her more within in her universe with her dd as a cop and the conflit between her and her dad with him hating spiderman well she is and with her being in spiderman 2099 team in the spider soicty also along with that pulling a strain on her and miles releationship just looking forward to see what she does more with her new spider group to help miles.,positive
208,"This job is totally a bad joke. If the duration of the movie is 140 minutes, you have to finalize the story. Meanwhile you can open a playful window to next episode. Do you make a movie or a tv show?I am so exhausted about this behavior. Let's make a movie. We have rap, we have Marvel, we have multiverse. Two years later we will do another film. It is easy, isn't it? We deserve better. We deserve some respect.First half of the movie is so empty. What are the characters doing? Okay, it may be. The audience is preparing. What about the second half? What did you tell us? Miles goes to spider universe and get trouble. So come on!",negative
209,"I have always loved the spider man movies so you can imagine how excited I was to go see this new one (especially with all the hype around it). If I'm being honest it was miserable. They somehow managed to make this movie unbearably boring but at the same time over stimulating to the point where I had a headache (I'm a teenager btw so the targeted audience). I genuinely have no idea how this movie originally got 9.1 stars, I mean when you compare it to a masterpiece like the Shawshank Redemption (9.3 stars) it seems stupid that it got such an incredibly high rating. Although the animation was good it certainly wasn't enough to make up for the fact that the film itself had no plot, no character development, and no point. Overall it feels generous to give this movie 3 stars.",positive
210,"STUNNING. Against all expectations, this film outmatches Into the Spider-Verse on every single level. These 2 and a half hours feature not just the best animation I have ever seen, but also emotionally authentic voice acting, genius writing, IMPOSSIBLY spectacular action sequences, and a bombass soundtrack.It's anti-authoritarian and disruptive to the canon (actual story thread, you'll know it when you see it) in a way the MCU never has the guts to be. My man Daniel Pemberton goes the f off, gifting modern cinema with the most hardcore and inventive superhero score of all time.I had trouble following some plot points which I'm sure will be cleared by revisits. I laughed, cried, and left the theater feeling that I could fly.Masterpiece. A technical goliath faster than the speed of light.",positive
211,"So far the greatest movie of 2023, and one of the best I have seen on the big screen in the latest years.Being excited about a movie usually means it won't exceed expectations however this one somehow manages to do just that. With amazing animation, great dialogue and character building it becomes a worthy successor to the first movie and even surpasses it in some ways, while the the first movie had a better score then this one it still succeeds to do better then the predecessor in almost every other way.This movie touches more on building other characters then Miles and let's those other characters shine far more then the first movie let them
All in all I believe the movie deserves many awards and a success in the box office like no other movie released this year.",positive
212,"I literally watched this movie at the cinema just to see Miguel (I'm down bad for him) and have like two hundred edits saved on tik tok of him, but got blessed by amazing animation, a very unique one that I couldn't focus on the plot that much because I admired the details and different art styles put in the animation progress, it has great plot, funny lines and new characters that got made with details that I didn't see anywhere. Miles has been a big part of the movie's awesomeness because of he had to deal with his own emotions and life problems while saving the world. I would absolutely recommend this movie. I got kinda angry by the fact that it ended at the most interesting scene and that I'll have to wait for part two. Even if it takes 3 years, idc how long it will take to make an awesome part two of this, I'll be patient and be the first one to find tickets at my nearest cinema!Summary: 10/10 movie with great animation, art style and character development and design.",positive
213,"This is a must watch! Absolutely love this film, every frame was bursting with color and it was just beautiful. I want to watch it again quite badly, that's how good it is. This is up there on the list of must watch movies! I walked into the theater expecting it to be just regurgitated plot from the first movie and yet it was entirely different. Dare I say the plot in this movie is better than the first. NEVER did you feel bored while watching it, it was enjoyable through the entire thing. The ending caused the whole theater to scream! I truly loved it and I hope you will too! Just a 10/10 movie.",positive

Don't miss your chance to experience this groundbreaking cinematic event - it's a web-slinging adventure like no other.",positive
215,"There has never been a movie so gorgeous as this one. Every scene, every character, every song, every plot line is just oozing beauty, color, style. They managed to take the core concept of what it is to be Spider-Man and use it as a sort of meta plot, and even be self aware of it, while making it extremely enjoyable in visuals, sounds, and feelings. This is undoubtedly a masterpiece of a movie. It has its own swagger for sure, it's like watching a masterful graffiti artist paint a picture before your eyes for 2 hours. If you don't see this in IMAX, center row, center of the row, you'll regret it.",positive
216,"I still think the first one is way better than this one. This one still has amazing graphics and action scenes, as well as an interesting story. The problem with this one is that is too long, almost 2 hour and a half long and completely unnecessary. Don't get me wrong, I watched a 3 hour-Lord of the rings movie like if it was 20 minutes. This one has too many subplots and too many scenes reserved only for jokes, and at some point, not just me but everyone one in the movie theater looked overwhelmed and stopped laughing. If they just have shortened 20 minutes of jokes and parents conversation would have been a lot better. Hope they do this for the third film.",positive
217,"When the first spider verse movie ended it was clear that Sony was going to make a sequel. I knew going into this movie the action and story were going to probably be better than the first. What I didn't know was that I was walking into one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. And that goes for both live action and animated films. From the moment it started to end I was hooked. The story was funny, dramatic, and enjoyable in a way that made me feel like the characters and story was actually real. And not just some mundane made up sci-fi story that's already been told a thousand times. By the end of the movie I was left wanting to see more, which for some movies is a bad thing, but for this movie I was only wanting more cause of how great everything I saw was. With the third movie coming out next year, I will be eagerly waiting for the story to continue.",neutral
218,"I don't understand why this movie got 9 rating. Me and my family had a hard time understanding half of the movie (and my friends too). Also the scenes are moving too fast, my eyes were burning from trying to follow all the characters movements. Last thing, how is possible that 1000 spiderman cannot catch 1 spiderman. They are supposed to be all spiderman so with an equivalent power. This is totally nonsense.I appreciate the first one but not this one
And I don't understand the hype (or did Sony paid for fake 10 ratings reviews?)Maybe it was only me, but no, my whole family and friends too.Not sure I will see the next one.",neutral
219,"Great direction, great animation, great soundtrack, great plot, great characters, there are so many good details on this movie that could make it the best superhero movie of all time. Animation makes you feel like you are seeing through comic book pages in a whole new level. The movie never feels weak or boring at any time and the sound work is very good, it needs to be seen the theater that's for sure. You can empathize emotionally with Miles as the movie goes through and the ending makes you want to travel time to just watch the second part of it, the only bad thing about this movie is that.... No there nothing wrong unless you don't like comics and superhero's.",positive
220,"Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse continues where Spider-man: into the spider-verse left of.What changed is the scale of the story and the with of animation used to tell the story. The first movie shook up the animation world in a positive way and we can see it's influence in movies like Puss in Boots 2. But this movie expands on it's ambition in animation to go even wilder and more inventive.All the beautiful animation won't be much if the story didn't live up to the animation. We have seen many Marvel films and tv series from Marvel/Disney that have degrade to the point of bloated CGI without any enticing stories, loveless created only to make money but don't deliver on the rich world the comic books have created. Thankfully Sony wiped the slate clean and created a unique, excited and touching story. Not only Miles Morales has an incredible story arch but every side character that is created for the story. Making all characters relatable and it makes you care.Go watch this movie if you can on the best screen you can find as it is worth your money and time and that is something we couldn't have said for a long time for a super hero movie.",positive
221,"The best movie in the entire Spider man franchise, but by far the best, everything but everything, narrative, animation, the OST: Calling, Self love, Hummingbird are masterpieces. Two and a half hours that seemed like 20 minutes, it was beautiful to see Gwen's universe and learn about her problems and difficulties to understand her and understand her better, after saying about Miles, how you grew up boy, of those people who give everything for their loved ones, Despite the fact that it can bring very big problems, it has been a long time since I wanted 2 characters to end up together, hopefully Gwen and Miles do.",positive
222,"The expectation wasn't that high but man! I was blown away!! I mean first spider man movie was my all time favourite but favourites was Miguel o'hara and surprisingly found him in this movie in a very good story telling very excited for the next part. I never thought miles morales story could be that interesting I mean in recent years I haven't watched any movies which push me to watch again but this one was masterpiece certainly this movie have huge potential I just hope that the part II will bring us justice and some laugh and cry, cheer and interest, I know expectations runes the joy but lets hopes.",positive

""Spider-Verse"" animated movie out currently. If you plan on watching, make sure to bring large sized bucket of joy and a fizzling soda full of adventure. Not only is the movie great to watch alone, this PG film will be a movie loved by families watching. If you enjoyed the previous, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" this will bring you into a shock with how incredible the movie is. I literally cannot stop talking about how good this movie is, the reason?

225,"It was fun to watch in the cinema. But this is for sure. Not as good as the first movie. In some scenes I was so bored, I even fell asleep. I don't think the effects are as good as the first movie. But still not bad of course. I had fun. Spidermen were great. It was so good to see different spidermen. The action wasn't bad either. The ""meme scene"" was so funny. But there was something that wasn't there. Also, the fact that they ended the movie halfway like a series lowered my respect for the movie. It was like a filler movie then. It could be better. Unfortunately, I don't know how the original voiceovers are not yet, since I watched it with dubbing. But I'm sure it's very good. Once again, I'll probably watch it in English. Anyway, I think it was a good animated movie, but not as good as the first movie.",positive

WHOEVER DID THE VOICE CASTING DID A PERFECT JOB! EVERYONE SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE MADE FOR THE ROLE AND IT WAS SO AWESOME SEEING SO MANY NEW SPIDERMEN AND SPIDERWOMEN! GOD DAMN THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE AND HOPEFULLY MORE STORIES FROM THE SPIDER VERSE COULD BE EXPLORED! PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS TO SUPPORT IT, EVERYONE WHO HELPED MAKE THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!",positive
227,"The sequel to the 2018 gem packs enough to match the hype created. This time Miles' Spider-Man gets his own nemesis, going by the name The Spot. The teenager tries hard to get his parents to ground him while triggering the nemesis with his humor. He misses Gwen who has joined the Spider Society and like any teenager, he wants Gwen and wants to be part of the society. How much of a serious threat The Spot gets to be and what does it cost to Miles' to save the spider-verse forms rest of the story.First, the visuals stand out again and the archival footages too got more cheers. They indeed set up the story well for Beyond the Spider-Verse. However, the plot felt overstuffed and since the final act was meant for setting up the story for the sequel, it simply drags on predictably. The stereotypical Mumbattan episode aside, the action and humor kept things engaging. Since the first movie went bonkers in it's final act, the sequel fell way short compared to that.",neutral
228,"Just lazy storytelling... Wherever you look these days (no matter Marvel or DC) there just a bunch of unrelated stories that are connected together by the ""Multiverse"". I mean come on! We get it, there are endless possibilities in across infinite universes but why should writers use this just to compensate for their inability to stick to and finish a story. How is it that whenever they are faced with challenges of their own making they just skip to another universe just to get rid of them.I miss the days when Comics were just about an old school story with complex characters with complex motivations. I think that alone can identify as a compelling script.",neutral
229,This is the best spider-man movie ever yes even better than Tobey Maguire and tom holland movies. Miles was the same character in the first movie really good. The animation was perfect no complaints Gwen was a better character in this movie than the first movie more intenersting and compelling. This is the best version of the Spot he was funny but over-time he became a huge threat to every spider-verse in fact every multi-verse. Miguel was ruthless and a very compelling antagonist. And every joke made me laugh.no bad jokes unlike the MCU now. I was suprised how good this was. The ending could make people disappointed but i wasn't i was hyped for the next one.,neutral

231,"The best Spider-Man movie yet and I think only ""Beyond the Spider-Verse"" can top it. One of the best animation I have ever seen and I am a sucker for anime. They really stepped it up from the first movie. Not only the animation but the soundtrack? Oh my good... Metro and Daniel Pemberton both did an amazing job. It isnt as powerful and ""hype"" action music as in the first movie but this soundtrack hits deep and in the right spots (haha) according to the movie. The story is spectacular and I think they will prove it even more in the next movie. See you in the theaters on 29th of March 2024! ...or maybe later?",positive
232,"Miles Morales did gave a great show this time in this movie. The way the story line goes is just breathtaking. Multiverse have already given Marvel infinite options to go with , In this movie they have utilized it wisely. As an Indian I am hyped to see Pavitr Prabhakar in this movie. He also spiced things up in the movie. Miguel O'Hara also known as the Spiderman 2099 made lots of impact in the movie. As the movie progressed more and more suspense was revealed which were all goosebumps moments, especially the climax. Earth 42 is going to offer lot more in the next movie and I am so excited to watch it. Love the whole movie , eagerly waiting for spiderman beyond the spider verse. Hope the next movie will be a Blast.",positive
233,"Just watched this amazing masterpiece and all i can say is WOW.I went into the cinema expecting a good movie but i never thought that i was about to watch the best Spider-Man movie EVER and probably the movie of the year! This sequel DESERVES nominations fellas!From the moment the movie starts until the very end you are HOOKED.The animation and character designs are absolutely amazing, all of the fight scenes are so well done and ""choreographed"", what a fantastic job by the animation team.The soundtrack is great and really fits into the movie and the characters like a glove.The pace is exquisite and really allows the characters to develop and show growth as the story progresses whilst we, the viewers, dont lose interest in it.An incredible amount of references are made in this movie to different Spider-Man Universes, such has Andrew Garfields, Tom Hollands and even the video game Spider Man gets a shout out! What a really fun way to acknowledge all the past Spider-Mans and to show that they really are all connected and to put Miles Morales Spider-Man next to all the other ones.The humor was actually surprising, because even though you are expecting to laugh when watching a Spider-Man movie, this sequel has really good timing on most of the jokes and one of the funniest characters of any Marvel franchise, in Spider Punk. Kudos to Daniel Kaluuya for giving us such a voice acting performance.This is, without a doubt, the best movie i have watched this year. It has emotions, growth and action, all we need in a super hero movie.It ends with a much expected cliff hanger for the next one and you best believe im going to watch it as soon as it comes out.9.5/10 - Absolutely Amazing.",positive
234,I havent seen a film as good as this film in a long time not only did it have a breakdown of what miles morales family was . This film was warm action pack and amazing visuals. The kind of film you wat to watch in the movie i was blown away how good it was and can see why people were lined up like crazy and even though i had terrible seats the film drew me in i was more than excited and left the film feeling like i watch something thats great and i am definetly watching this film a bunch of times. Honestly the same feeling i had watching the first dark night with the joker i left feeling like this was definetly movie of the tear and its crazy that it was a animation film. Honestly this movie is just as good a wall e which was another amazing film if you havent watch it do yourselfs a favor and go watch the movie of the year im calling it now.,positive
235,"Across The Spider-verse is very much a product of its moment. Very aware that by this point the things it needs to do to separate itself from the never ending releases of superhero movies. It is meta in the best way, not only bringing a comic book to life but also acknowledging directly what its doing. The animation and soundtrack are top notch. The movie literally bounces of the comic book page. But for all the color, the style, and the swagger. This film has flaws. Most notably a missing third act. This film establishes characters sets up a conflict and then ends. Its insistence to repeat the same beats over and over again is annoying. Leading to a movie that is far too long for the story it did tell. But too short for the story it could have told. By tightening the pacing and giving the movie an extra half an hour it could have been done. Is this a masterpiece, no not really. I believe that with time the hype will die down and people will settle to a more realistic score. But it certainly is fun!",positive

237,"Firstly, I loved the first spiderverse film and it is my favourite spiderman film of them all. Sam raimi's spiderman 2 being my second favourite. That's just to let you have a feel if my review is likely to be similar to yours, if you agree with my top 2. Ten out of ten for the first film, so to be fair, this one had a lot to live up to. First half of the film, I found my mind wandering a bit. Nice animation but at times, the action shots were really not clear. Family stuff was very well done but the main baddy was hard to take serious. The film definitely got much better in the second half which is a huge relief as I really did not want to not like this film. It doesn't have the humour of the first film or as good music, but it still improved enough, for me to go and see the third film.",positive
238,"Imagine a film where you take characters who were incredibly well developed in the prequel, learned hard lessons and responsibility, and were actually likeable. Then spend a few hours tearing all that apart. Then light the likeable parts of the characters on fire and make one of them an anarcho-socialist. Mix it all together with a few cliches and you have this disaster piece that manages to disappoint at all but the visual stage. How this tripe was greenlit is beyond me and I deeply regret the time and money lost in viewing it.Save yourself the time and frustration of seeing into the spider verse get the redemption arc flipped and miles Morales willing to burn the world.",neutral
239,"This is my favorite animated film of the year and was better than I was expecting (as I'm over the whole multiverse storyline in films). It took a horrible comic villain and made it into a formidable foe; it took one of my favorite Spider-Mans (Spider-Man 2099) and made him into a formidable and flawed hero/villain, and it crafted and amazing story for both leads, while also ending the story in Part 1 while setting up another spin-off story for Part 2. I also loved the mix of animation styles as it made sense to the story (and wasn't just a gimmick) and the music score was perfect! One of the best films of '23 in my opinion.",positive

His expression was one of pure joy and utterly caught up in the story.Even is amped up, the range of art styles, the range of spider-people, the depth of story, performances. Everything is divine.Picking up with Gwen, lost and out of focus, missing Miles who is letting spider work take over school.Obviously they meet up and the fun kicks up. But when I say everything works it does. The laughs from Miles parents, the loss the Gwen's father for his lost daughter.The music is a perfect fit again. This movie is just a joy, it's darker, bigger, and just outstanding.",positive
241,"I won't go to the details of the spectacular movie this is. This is just the perfect sequel.I am just here to explain why people are sour even when they enjoyed the movie.Because it ends without a closure.Yes, guys, I get it. You crave for more, we all deserve the end but, that 9 months wait will be worth the wait.This will be perfect than the endgame. I believe that.Every frame is a painting, the emotional dramatic scenes are important and a requirement for a better payoff.Watch it a second time and you will not be hating at the cliffhanger. You will appreciate it more. You will understand the decisions that were made to be where it is now.You are just trying to feed into your brain wanting things to have closure, the satisfaction of your time invested.Fear not, March 2024 will satisfy that even more.As for the movie, I can't stop thinking about it any less. Even after 2nd watch, I want to go few more times to enjoy only in theaters. Your brain gets happy with that art you are being able to witness in such an adorable cost.Appreciate everyone involved in this movie, appreciate the animators, appreciate the sound designers and to the writers.9.5.",positive
242,"Next to Spider-Man: No Way Home, Across the Spider-Verse takes the top spot as the best Spidey film I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing! It is incredible, a feast for the eyes, and full of humor and heart! There are so many Easter Eggs to spot throughout the movie, and it is so much fun to try to spot them, you never know what, or WHO might pop up in the story! ðŸ‘€This ambitious sequel delves heavily into the Spider-Man mythos, and continues the story of Miles Morales Spider-Man from the Into the Spider-Verse film, but it adds more depth to some other characters that we fell in love with in the first film while introducing some other Spider-powered people. This time, they're on a mission to stop the destruction of the multiverse, by a madman known only as The Spot, who can portal in and out of the different universes within the Spider-Verse on a mission to destroy all Spiders! That's not all though, as the leader of the Spider team, Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) comes into conflict with Miles about his place in the Spider-Verse and what it truly means to be Spider-man!Featuring a massive voice cast including Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Jason Schwartzman, Karan Soni, Daniel Kaluuya, Oscar Isaac, Greta Lee, Mahershala Ali, Andy Samberg, Rachel Dratch, Zoe Kravitz, and many many, many more, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse does truly deliver! It's a sequel that does it's job even better than the first movie, times ten! Go see this movie even if you aren't a Spider-Man or superhero fan, it's an incredible spectacle!!And, the ending of the film is one of the most spectacular endings to a movie I've seen since Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame!",positive
243,"I have made a review about how great the animation of the previous movie is, but god, this movie animation is on whole another level, the transitions between every scene and the next one is smooth and so well done, you wont be disappointed at all!In this movie, ""The Spot"" is the main antagonist, which has the ability to move between multiverses at will (well, almost), at some point of the movie the main protagonist (Miles Morals) is forced to fight him in order to save the ones he love, however the movie end in a good cliffhanger.We also see characters from previous movies coming back to this movie, and of course, the main focus was on Gwen and the lazy peter parker.Character development wise, I quite liked the developing relationship between Miles Morals and Gwen.And once again, I will say the same thing I said for previous movie, this does not really offer a ""new plotline"" at all, it is just marvel movie with extraordinary animation, and the character development felt better in this movie than any other marvel movies somehow.My rate to this movie is 9/10!Definitely watch it!",positive
244,"I struggled giving it 10/10, but i can't think of a negative thing here.First of all the music is perfect. Especially the intro / Gwen Stacy part was perfect here. Her emotions amplified by the drums. Her vs. Peter and when she puts on the costume in her room going into the next fight and the whole fight theme. Everything was elevated by the music perfectly and hyped me up for the complete first part of the movie.And the art style ... it is just beautiful. It is brave to have such unique art style for a whole movie and it pays of. Every scene is a piece of art. If you have the video, you can pause like every frame and make a wallpaper out of it.The story was good too. When you thought it was predictable, it wasn't (e.g. Hey there is this machine that brings you back to your universe - that will absoluteley be used later - but didn't see the plot twist here)
Also some deep plote lines everywhere. The movie was long and i was never bored. Worst was the TBC. (but a plus for the movie itself, because you wanted to continue to watch)I wanted to make a minus point on the fast combat/swing scenes, but even there - it was fast, sometimes hard to follow but it still had a really nice flow to it that made it enjoyable. They were able to make every move of the Spider-whatever powerful and impactful.Half of the movie was a Spider Gwen movie and i wasn't even mad about it. The character is so good, that i hope they will make a Spider Gwen spin-off.",neutral
245,"The animation is, as expected, absolutely spectecular. But thats about it.The first half is a collection of mediocre build-up, unfunny jokes and the ridiculing of potentially interesting characters, which sort of ruins the second half.Then we know that Miles is somewhat stronger than any of the other spiderpeople, but for some reason that great chase was supposed to be exciting.As a whole, there is Gwens conflict with her father, the teen drama of Gwens conflict with Miles, the conflict of Miles and Gwen with the spiderpeople and Miles conflict with his parents, but none of these in particular really stand out.The movie looks amazing (in terms of every 20 seconds having a phrame that looks beautiful on its own), but it wants too much. Is it comedy? Action? Drama? Arthouse? And does it do any of it actually well?It is chaotic and boring but very nice to watch.It was very hard to superceed the first one though.",positive
246,"Being a big fan of into the spider-verse, I had high expectations. Somehow across the spider verse exceeds those.The great animation style that we witnessed in the first spider verse film, is expanded upon, with new characters and styles that adds to a film that sometimes feels and looks like art.The consstant shift between locations and different characters, creates a fun experience, that does not feel dragged out. Meanwhile Miles and Gwen work as exciting characters, while still having great chemistry between each other.This film is a masterpiece, and by far the best spider man film of all time, I would definitely recommend across the spider verse!",positive
247,"Although it's somewhat of a joyful superhero movie, unlike Into The Spider Verse, it's very hard to follow. Into The Spider Verse was a very good movie that had a clear climax. This film has no real climax and it's so incredibly busy with all the multi verse situation that you cannot even follow it for a few minutes. One thing happens then something else is happening. I was expecting a lot from this movie with an overall rating of 8.7/10 but it really doesn't deserve it. From the very beginning there's no real major event that occurs. Throughout the movie it looks like you're watching a comic book, not a movie. There's so many things occuring at the same time that you really don't know what's happening. This is not the case for any other Spider Man movie, which I personally have enjoyed to the point where I rated No Way Home 9/10. I would also rate Into The Spider Verse an 8/10, but this was a let down.",positive
248,"Saw the 9.0 here and was super excited to see this film. Very disappointing! Plot moves at light speed, and continues to jump around the whole film. Scenes flash every 2 seconds and it was exhausting to follow. Animation is excellent, but this movie lacked the hook that made the first one so good. Maybe this is where movies are now headed, but I hope not. For a show aimed toward a younger audience, the film was way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes and seemed to hold the audience hostage. Very hard to keep track of all the characters and plot shifts. Was hoping for something better but it seemed like a comic book on speed.",positive
249,"Spider Man across the spider verse was nearly perfect. The only flaw was the ending. It did rap up well though. Gwen assembled a Spider Man team to find Miles, Miles went to a universe were his uncle was still alive, and that Miles was the Prowler. So it really did get me excited for the next one, but at the same time I was pissed off that I have to wait another year to see it. It was a cliffhanger, but a good one. The ending could of been worse though, because I thought it was going to end with the Spot arriving in Gwen's current universe, and start attacking Miles's Dad. Just imagine that cliffhanger. Other then the ending, the movie was perfect. It had an amazing soundtrack, amazing action, amazing comedy. Amazing acting. The best part though was the small cameos, e.g when it showed the lady from the dairy in Venom, and Donald Glover as the Prowler. I'd recommend this movie, but not for little kids, because the plot is to confusing. It involves a lot of multiverse madness, that you really have to pay attention in order to understand.",positive
250,"I went in with high expectations after hearing much praise for the movie from friends and critics alike. I thought i had expected Too much and was gonna be disappointed but boy was I wrong. From start to finish I could not take my eyes off the screen. The journey that miles and Gwen both go through in the movie is amazingly executed. The comedy is on point and the cameos are amazing, especially pavitr prabhakar, his intro sequence was just so enjoyable and relatable. Miguel O'Hara was well played and Peter B Parker was once again an amazing mentor to miles. The last act was done perfectly and the plot twist was not totally unexpected but still done well. The ending was thrilling and as much as I didn't want it to end in a cliff hanger, it was the best way to end of this movie. Really a fully enjoyable experience and the music is on point. The visuals are stunning and animation is masterful.",positive
251,"This one's going in my number 1 spot. Can't complain at all. Haven't found a better role model and probably never will. This movie came in at a time of high depression for me and definitely helped out a lot. The variety in the movie is immaculate. Same goes for the voice cast, the animation and the sound, oh my god the sound in this movie is a massive case study and will teach generations to come. The first movie was already amazing and this had some crazy expectations to follow. They broke all expectations I had and shattered the roof with this amazing hit. The humor, the love and the heart in this movie is amazing.",positive
252,"What a movie!! Animation was secondary, the story... omg story was sooo good.BGM is sooo perfect. Hummingbird, Calling you, Self love.. they r just too good n fits perfectly..Interrelation of both movies (Into the spider verse) and in this is soo cool..Representation of miles character and his mindset of doing both saving his family and his universe as he said in 'Into the spider verse' that he will always have his family..Introduction of Spider punk! Man he's not hobie he is HOMIE.Indian Spiderman ""Pav"" is super cute and plays important role in the movie.. (btw love the way he swings, just super unique and satisfying)Gwen learning to take 'leap of faith' from miles is soo deep.. she keeps being scared of messing things up and not harming the one she loves the most (obviously miles) but in other hand miles is ready to risk it all..Miguel is super cool.. has other perception towards faith and multiverse (just like Dr strange)AND can't just get over the cuteness of Mayday.. She is super cute !!!JUST CANT WAIT OF ACROSS THE SPIDER VERSE!I JUST WANT MILES AND GWEN TOGETHER ANYHOW.",positive
253,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has absolutely stunning visuals (as expected), incredible and natural voice acting, lovable characters with great character development, amazing music and much more.Since the first movie was so breathtaking, this sequel had a lot to live up to. However, it definitely met or even surpassed my expectations. In my opinion, Spider-Verse 2 is undoubtedly a worthy successor to the first film. In fact, I believe that it's one of the best animated movies of 2023 - if not of all time.Oh and also, it's full of little hidden details and Easter eggs! I can't wait to watch it again and try to Spot more of them (pun intended).Everyone who worked on this film did an outstanding job and deserves more praise. Just incredible. No need to say more.",positive
254,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was amazing! The unique animation style, the clear effort put in to create thousands of ""spider-beings"", the hectic yet clear to follow action made this aist watch on the large screen type experience. But what's most impressive is the movies ability to go from a funny banter filled Spidey movie to pull you into Some of the most emotional scenes seamlessly. No other movie in this genre (and very few movies in general) is able to make you feel just so many emotions, and not just by killing off characters, but with a relatable situations and vulnerability that makes it feel so genuine. All the characters are flushed out, all motivations seem plausible. The story and dialogue are some of the best, helped along by a kick-ass soundtrack (although into the spider verse probably has it beat). The only frustrating part of the movie was that it makes you want for more and ends on a cliff hanger that furthers that sentiments. Easily one of my favourite movies, a joy tO watch.",positive
255,"I am the biggest fan of the first movie, in fact I watch it nearly every month and had very high hopes from this one. First of all, the good part. Animation is on point and looks really cool. Some shots had a static texture overlayed on the 3D character which looked cheap but everything else just blows your hair back. All the action seems very seamless and flows naturally from one scene to another in the well known spidy fighting style. Some jokes land pretty well (not most though).Now the bad part, the overall tone of the movie was much more casual/comedic (going the MCU route) than the first one and I REALLY don't like unnecessary humour. There are multiple characters that take up a good chunk of screen time whom I didn't care about a single bit and found myself checking the phone multiple times during the movie. In fact Miles only took 10% of the screen time. I always cherished spiderman as a hero who is witty, funny and relatable (although I am not white) but super special, and this movie somehow shatters that ""specialness"". Everybody is a spiderman - a dude on a wheelchair, a pregnant women, overweight people, dinosaurs.. it felt like artistic thinking took the front wheel instead of common sense. The other thing that I disliked was that how there was SO MUCH ""talking about your feelings"" in the movie, which was almost non-existent in the first. I went to watch a action packed adventure and got almost a therapy session for 10 other characters whom I have no interest in.To really like this movie you have to be
1) NOT a spiderman fan
2) super progressive in your thinking
I would have given it a lower score but the animation team really created a masterpiece which will be referenced for times to come. Hugely disappointed by the youtube critics for not pointing any flaws and following the herd and giving it a 10/10.",neutral
256,"It's obvious that a significant amount of effort has gone into the visual aspect of this movie, though there was so much going on that I felt exhausted at the end of the film, having tried to take in so much of what I could see.I didn't personally think that this had a really strong and cohesive storyline, which may be due to it being part 1. I walked away from the cinema thinking it looked amazing but not feeling engaged by the story.Our 9 year old loved it but he was disappointed he has to wait to find out how the story ends.To me this was a case of style over substance.I am pretty sure the majority of people who see it will disagree with my views, but this how I felt after seeing it.",positive
257,"This movie topped Into The Spider-Verse for me, and it was only the first part. It handled all of the characters from the previous movie insanely well, and introduced several well written & presented new characters too - a highlight for me being Spider Punk / Hobie Brown.I loved the different styles in the various universes visited in the film, and how each character was designed accordingly. Callbacks to past media were handled gracefully and made sense in terms of the plot, as were cameos from both well liked / well known characters and new characters from other media.The soundtrack was on point AGAIN. The plot was easy to follow but not at all predictable. There were at least 10 times in the last half hour or so where I was wondering whether it would be the cliff-hanger ending. The point at which it ended felt natural.Amazing animation. Amazing plot. Amazing characters. Amazing music. Unbelievable progression from ITSV and an incredible basis for BTSV to build from.",positive
258,"I like the movie, it's great. It has really much and good animation that my eyes can't believe. The movies story is... okay. My eyes needed to focus everywhere and every second because they're were so much stuff going on. Honestly. I can't complain. But i need to complain a bit about these things.The movie has a cliffhanger in the end. WHY??!!! JUST WHY??!!! ON THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE!!!You think that someone is going to get hurt so it gets tons of action. BUT NO. The person that is the good or bad guy OBVIOUSLY LIVES for a spiderman like saving them.Yes, this movie had some funny jokes, comedy and stuff, but it's just no difference compared to other kids movies except the animation. I don't know why this movie has a 8,5/10I thought this was going to be a hype movie. A bit, but not quite.I'm quite disappointed.",positive
259,"How do so many people think this is a 10/10 masterpiece? The only thing that saves this movie is the animation, because it is absolutely superb! But almost every other part of this movie is average at best.First of all this movie just feels like a overdone superhero movie. I mean every 20 minutes or so there was some kind of cheesy emotional scene that didn't really say anything, it was just cringe.Most of the dialogue was like every other typical superhero movie, but more cheesy and cringe. Very and i mean VERY few jokes actually landed. It did get a little better at the end tho, but not a lot.There was nothing surprising about the movie and its story. Spiderman gets put in a situation where he shouldn't be, then he messes something up or finds out something that poses a big problem. And then he goes to fix it even tho he isn't supposed to jadajadajada you get the point. It's the same movie just with different characters. It was pretty much like No Way Home, just worse in my opinion.And the part that completely ruined the movie. THE ENDING. How can anyone who watched this movie to the end, say it was 10/10. It makes no sense, no sense at all. This is the biggest cash grab i've seen since Infinity War and Endgame and they weren't bad at all. But this is on another level. The 1st movie was 100x better than this, definitely wouldn't reccomend.",positive
260,This is a Spider-Man movie like you will be shock. This is better than the first one and the cameos are crazy. The ending is awesome and you just want to see more. Trust me this movie is worth it. You will love it. I cannot wait for Beyond the Spider Verse. So yeah go see it at a movie theater. You can't see it when it comes out on streaming or DVD. See it in theaters it is worth the money. This is better than Spider-Man No Way Home too. This is the best Spider-Man movie ever. This movie also has great character development and just does everything right so yeah if you see this review go watch the movie.,positive
261,"Without spoiling anything I just want to give a brief summary about this movie and how it is mindblowingly good.Just as I thought the last movie was already awesome, I thought this one would be as good or less. But it surpassed my expectations in an excellent way. This is the magnum opus of all animation in my opinion. It just combines so many different styles in one coherent movie, with an excellent story, cast and performances. I really was disappointed by the huge cliffhanger in the end, in a good way. Definitely going to rewatch this movie very soon, there are so many layers to this movie. In my opinion you can't fully appreciate what's on screen with just one watch, you need to see it multiple times to really let it sink in. This is definitely a highlight of the movies I watched this year so far.",positive
262,"I rarely ever leave reviews on movies but I just had to say a couple of things about Across the Spider-Verse. The first movie was already so amazing that it inspired creativity in the animation industry but this installment just finessed its style. The different universes and styles, different animations; there were genuine moments where I felt chills just looking at the screen.I'm a story guy, I can appriciate good cinematography and visuals but the main thing that gets me going while watching movies is the story and let me tell you something: THIS IS SOME DAMN GOOD WRITING. The dialogue feels so alive and realistic, the small mimics and details make you feel like every scene was spent countless hours on to perfect. It all comes together beautifully. It works amazing as both a sequel and the set up of the third film, yet it is also a great standalone film as my friend who hasn't seen the first one also found it amazing.We can't forget the acting, as good as the animations and the hand drawings are amazing, the voice acting is as spectacular if not better than the first film. There has never been a moment which a character seemed dull or insensible. Props to all the voice actors, especially Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfield. I don't know the recording process of the voice lines but Miles and Gwen didn't have one moment where it didn't feel like I was watching a chemical reaction.The only thing that made me sad is that as the time frame got closer to the end, I expected the movie to end the way it did. I'm not mad because it ended the way it did but because I thought I'd have to wait 3 or 4 years for the sequel. Thank god it is announced to release next year so that's that.Whether you're an elder, adult, teen, or a child; this Spider-Verse story has something for you. Not only you'll enjoy the experience of watching a comic book; you'll also go through a fun, but heartfelt story. I think this is a movie everyone should see.",positive
263,"I never thought Into the Spider Verse was a movie that needed a sequel, but Across the Spider Verse is just as incredible as Into the Spider Verse. The animation style is even more beautiful than in the first movie, every shot looks like a painting. The exploration of Miles and Gwen and what it really means to be Spider Man is excellent, and leads to so many deep and emotional moments. Every scene with Miles' parents were top tier. The voice cast all gave it everything they had, and Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen was the stand out for me. The cliffhanger ending was so epic, it actually gave me chills. If the third movie is as good as these first two this might become the best trilogy of all time. 10/10.",positive
264,"Wow wow wow. This is absolute masterpiece, cannot fault it at all. The animation is probably the best I've ever seen. The level of detail is ridiculous and the amount of effort that went into making this is clearly shown. The voice acting is great, the music is great, it's funny and lots of cool Easter eggs. The story is great as well and leads perfectly into the sequel which I absolutely cannot wait for.I wouldn't be surprised if not only if this was nominated for best animated picture at the Oscars but also best picture, it's that good.There's nothing more to say, just go watch it in yh Cinema and appreciate the art!",positive
265,"Wow. An already great year for movies, just got extended by a masterpiece of filmmaking.Just as Into the Spider-Verse did before it, Across the Spider-Verse uses the audience's familiarity with Spider-Man as a consistent source of humor which makes it all flow flawlessly.I am quite frankly obsessed with this movie. There are six different animation styles featured in the film - and my goodness this is the most awe-inspiring animation I've ever seen in a film. Using stunning visuals as a way to elevate the emotion and action in every scene. Never seen the like. The voice acting is sublime (the dialogue between Miles and Gwen goes right under the skin), the characters are multi-faceted, the action sequences are electric, the music is mesmerizing and, my word, the storyline is the perfect balance of emotional depth and meticulously timed comic relief.I also love how Across the Spider-Verse balances setting up a sequel while being its own movie. Miles and Gwen have tidy and concluding arcs with enormous growth, as it still ends on a true cliffhanger. It's among the best part ones I've ever seen.This movie is pure art put on canvas, with every frame. Soulfull. A genuine love letter to Spider-Man and filmmaking itself.Note:
It's time for everyone to appreciate animated film as a true film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly demonstrates that you can't achieve and convey the same with a live-action film as with an animated film. The richness of emotions that this masterpiece conveys benefits greatly from the animation and its mesmerizing style.",positive
266,"I know this film has been raved about but I just found it to be a poor imitation of the first film. They leaned into the animation too much. It's too much. A couple of scenes were brilliantly done but too many were trying to be clever and over saturated the scenes to the detriment of the film itself. The story was too complicated but by the final third, it was too simple.The end of the film sets up the next film in an interesting way but it doesn't make this the best film or even best animated film of the year. I just hope that they return to the way they did the first film especially with colours and animation.",neutral
267,Okay most movies don't have that great of a sequel but spider man across the spider verse isn't one of those. For. Started this movie had a great dose of action and humour and romance. One of the reasons why this movie works is that it has a whole universe to explore. And the characters are easy to love. And in this movie they explore Miles and Gwen relationship with each other. And Peter has MJ and a child. And all the characters they can have. There's so much references to The whole spider verse. And this movie lives up to the first one and it might be one of the best animated movie of all times.,positive
268,I thought the movie was just ok. The animation was pretty annoying. I thought the story was all over the place sometimes less is more. I enjoyed certain points in the movie that was more grounded such as the scenes with Gwen and Miles also the scene with Peter and Miles and his baby. The scene where Miles gets away from like a thousand spiderman versions is utterly ridiculous. The Scenes with Gwen and Her dad were great and Miles and his parents. I guess you can't have a more grounded movie in a multiverse movie and I should have expected that. This movie wasn't for me but I am sure many people enjoyed it. I probably won't watch it again cause I really only enjoyed certain elements of the movie.,positive
269,"Except for the amazing soundtrack in most parts of the movie and some songs, there is nothing worth watching in the film.It's a movie about teenagers struggling with distraction, lack of understanding from society and their parents, and their journey into different worlds to engage in a battle between good and evil and form a team to stop the person or entity that will destroy the worlds (isn't this a repetitive story that we've seen in 99% of superhero movies?). A story that seems to be the only one Marvel creators know, and keep recycling it in different forms.The graphics and colors are disturbing, the dialogues are repetitive causing headaches and annoyance. There are unnecessary flashy scenes without any dramatic reasons, all for the sake of grabbing the attention of the ADHD generation.This is just one of those bad experiences, and throughout the movie, I kept asking myself one question: why is this incredibly and insanely overhyped? It's just another Avengers movie with a recycled story and teenage protagonists!",positive
270,"My expectations were high with this film due to several reasons, especially taking into account how good the first one was. And still, it exceeded all of them. I cannot explain anything that hasn't been already told by everyone, critics and fans alike: the animation, the story-line, the soundtrack, the action scenes... everything is perfect and calculated even to the last detail. So polished, so carefully prepared. When the end of the film hit, I was ready to watch one more hour of the story, so it leaves you wanting, asking for more. In a 2 hour movie that is a tremendous achievement.I enjoyed it like a child and I could watch it several times more until the final part releases, which has a very difficult bar to reach, by the way.",positive
271,"I want to go back and rewatch this movie again and again. It was so good that it has to be my favorite movie of all time now. The visuals and art are beautiful just like the first movie but this one has so many more plot twists and intense scenes mixed with comedy and it's just the perfect movie. I love how smart he is and his point in the movie, his wants and who he's trying to save it's perfect, I want a year to go by right now so I can watch the second part of the movie. Man this movie is a must watch even if u didn't watch the first movie although things are less confusing and more of wow factors if uve watched the first movie!",positive
272,"I loved this movie so much! I waited 5 years for this movie and to my surprise it was a good movie. The plot was confusing at first but when Miguel O Hara explained it in the movie it made much more sense. I loved that they added lots of easter eggs, cameos and most importantly all of the different versions of Spider Man. As a Spider Man fan myself I really enjoyed this movie. The only thing I didn't like about it is that there was a cliff hanger and Spider Man didn't even fight The Spot. The animation was impeccable and the characters were well written. At least the movie comes out in 2 years instead of 5. This movie has probably been my top 3 list of favorite films of 2023.",positive
273,The people who made this movie did so with craft and immense creativity. This random person on the internet tips their hat to you.I found the themes of this movie to be incredibly appealing and personally relevant. The animation is stellar and I am very eager to see more when the follow up comes out.The original music in this film is near perfection. It is implemented perfectly within each scene. I find myself annoyed with the majority of soundtracks that fit the same formula. This is no such soundtrack.I really hope the care that was put into this film is put into the sequel and I truly believe this movie will last generations (contingent on the world doing so).,neutral
274,"Is the best movie of the decade an over exaggeration for this movie? To put it simply, no. Everything about this film is perfect.... well, other than the stupid cliff hanger ending. But i've learn to accept it overtime. Anyway the animation is spectacular. It has so many little details that you've 100% missed. The story is also amazing. The characters all have great writing and some with unique art styles like spider-punk having different art styles almost everytime we see him because he hates consistensy. Speaking of spider-punk he's definely my fav character. I hope he gets more screen time in the 3rd installation, beyond the spider-verse. Anyways this movie is perfect and I really look forward for the final installation for this series.",positive
275,"Oh my god, I can't believe that the visuals and sound of Part 2 are actually even more groundbreaking and superior than many previous parts. That is so insane!On the first day the new movie was released, I immediately ran to the theater with my brothers to enjoy the best quality movie-watching experience. Right from the opening moments, I was very impressed with the animation style with flexible, smooth movements and combined with the comic book quality. My favorite scene is probably the conversation between Gwen Stacy and her father. The color tones change continuously according to the emotions of the two characters, very beautiful and vivid.There are many more beautiful scenes like the 4 spider-men rescuing people in the pavitr universe combined with the music to make that scene incredibly awesome, the spider-verse explanation scene is equally cool and there's also an easter egg. The sound is really lively and great, there's nothing to criticize.Overall, the movie is great and you should watch it!I can't wait to watch ""Spider-man: Beyond the Spider-verse""",positive
276,"Loved the visuals and how they convey emotion, the dialogue was fluid and refreshing, some new characters were written poorly and portrayed as evil even though they were right (a missed opportunity for a great character dililemma instead of just not doing what mean guy says), and annoying ending. The entire movie was full of great emotion, but I didn't feel myself truly invested until the twist in the 3rd act, and then the movie just ends. In contrast to the previous film, the villain is entertaining and the fights are extreme, but not so much as to confuse to what I'm seeing. This films predecessor perfectly wrapped a nice bow around the end and left it on a nice lead into this movie. Instead this movie squanders its time with introducing new characters instead of advancing the plot. Lots of fat to be trimmed, good humor, but overall just a set up film for the next. I only hope the third lives up to the first.",positive
277,"I want to highlight the main points that can be called fundamental for the Spiderverse sequel:1. The artstyle. On the big screen, it looks really stunning. Each universe is shown in a unique way. Spider-punk, has a harsh artstyle in muted colors. Rough lines convey the same rebellious and explosive nature of the character. Gwen's emotions are served by the lightwork. Blue and orange colors change during the scenes with their father at the very beginning. The da Vinci era Vulture is also interestingly stylized. Artists are not afraid to use different stylistic devices to capture the essence. And it works!2. Music. Especially a big plus for me. It is very different for every universe. When we need to exhale, the music does it with us. There is a tense scene and the music makes you hold your breath. Or when the serene dialogue is accompanied by the ringing ambience of the city.3. The story of a young struggling superhero. A story that must include tons of action. In the opening scene with Miles, in his actions, we are already introduced to his daily routine, his interests, conflicts with his parents, problems with his studies, his environment and the city where he lives. All this on his way to school. Fast. Dynamic. Bright. You can notice a lot references to pop culture and memes. I definitely liked how harmoniously the movie uses fan service.Overall, is the movie worth watching? Yes! Even if you didn't get to see the first part? Yes!The film tells a good story. You will understand everything even without watching the first part.",positive
278,"The film wasn't as good as the first, but it is still worth watching.It started off great, but it wasted too much time touching themes that were covered in the first film, and thus bloated the film and made it boring for people that have seen the first film.They introduced a universe of whimsical spider-man beings/versions. I enjoyed the newly introduced spider-people such as, what I refer to as, ""Foxy Brown"" Spider-man, which was a great nod to the blacksplotation films of the 70s.The thing that frustrated me most was the ""to be continued"" nonsense ending. The film could have been trimmed in places , and extended slightly in runtime, in order to make time for a ending.",positive
279,I saw this movie today and had high hopes from the trailers and the first movie. The first hour was the depressing and awkward family drama life of Gwen and Miles which could've been like 10 minutes or maybe not even happen. The scene where all the spidermen are together and the chase scene might have been one of or even the only amazing scene in the movie making everything quick and to the point. The last 30 minutes is ok with him being in the wrong dimension and the story coming together but it didn't need to be 2 hours to get to this. In the end it was almost all filler or extended too long.,positive
280,"I loved the first one and have no idea why it took me so long to watch the 2nd... its absolutely incredible. It doesn't feel like a sequel, just a continuation of an incredible story. The acting is brilliant, the animation is the best I've ever seen and I absolutely love cartoons. The sound track is another master piece. Great level of humour and the character development is fantastic. Genuine care in animation is rare, but they nail it every step.of the way. Even if you don't like super hero movies, or animation, you'll still like it, that's just how good the film is. Honestly. So watch it already.",positive
281,"Across The Spider-Verse blew me away! When I saw the trailers, I did not think I was going to be that into the film (as the sequel does not tend to be better than the original in most cases). Although I did have a slight problem with the fact that we spend a whole hour and three minutes (almost half the film) in Miles' universe. I watched the film the first day it was out in the UK, and as much as it was 2hrs 20 minutes long, it was an enchanting piece of entertainment. It was definitely worth the wait for this piece of MARVEL content. Best animated movie of 2023 in my opinion. I would recommend to everyone who reads this review.",positive
282,"From a technical and animation point of view, needless to say it is a masterpiece, I can see that there was a tremendous amount of work behind it and I am glad that it was so successful because of that. The only thing, I find it perhaps a bit excessive visually, moments with too many colors, lights and effects that although excellently done could perhaps have been reduced, but that is a matter of taste.Story that takes, with some nice emotionally touching moments, a good handling of the characters (considering the huge amount of characters in the scene I would say they did the best they could), some absurdities or elements out of the lines which however are totally justified by the context and subject (we are still talking about people bitten by radioactive spiders that there provided with super powers) and some nice twists and unexpected drifts.The ending... if you can call it that cuts the film right at the most beautiful putting in hype for the sequel.",positive
283,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves a perfect 10/10. This sequel to the groundbreaking ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" surpasses all expectations with its innovative storytelling, stunning visuals, and deeply emotional character arcs.The film dives deeper into the multiverse, introducing audiences to an even wider array of Spider-People from various dimensions. The plot is both complex and accessible, blending humor, action, and heartfelt moments seamlessly. Miles Morales, our protagonist, continues to grow and evolve, facing new challenges that test his limits as a hero and a person. His journey is compelling and relatable, highlighting themes of identity, responsibility, and the importance of staying true to oneself.Visually, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is nothing short of spectacular. The animation style is a vibrant mix of comic book aesthetics and cutting-edge CGI, creating a unique and mesmerizing experience. Each universe has its distinct artistic style, making every scene visually dynamic and exciting.

285,"While I will say I was very excited about seeing this movie when I saw the trailer for it about three months ago, after watching it I will say that it was a good movie but it wasn't the greatest one. For me it felt like the story was all over the place and there were some moments that I felt weren't really necessary to the plot of the movie itself. Plus it was almost two and a half hours which was a little longer than I wanted it to be! Acting was great, visually it was amazing but because of the story I will have to give it a 6 out of 10! I feel like maybe five years in between was too long!!",positive
286,"Who would've thought the bagel guy from the first movie would become one of the most interesting villains in this movie? Not me! This film is fantastic; the animation is such eye candy to look at; every shot is spectacular; and the characters are fleshed out and feel human-like in the first film.Another thing I like is the multiverse aspect. I know that it has started to feel overdone due to Marvel and other film franchises starting to use that for their storylines, but this felt fresh and original, and was one of the first to do it, so I cut them some slack.This film is also emotional and introduces the term ""Canon Event"" which means an event you can't stop. A character loses a loved one, and it makes them shut in and won't talk to anyone, which I know is an overdone trope, but I rolled with it. Finally, the cinematography was substantial, with many nice shots to look out and neat and creative transitions.So, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a marvelous feat in animation filmmaking and a film that I think everyone should check out if they want to have their time and money well spent by watching this masterpiece.",positive
287,"It had less choppy editing and over the top music. The story was interesting how it opened with Gwen not fitting in for a rock band and hiding her identity from her father, who assumes Spider-Woman is responsible for the death of Peter Parker when she was really battling the Lizard Monster he became from a potion. Strange that the movie opens with her, but not Miles, who battles the guy that created the radioactive spider that turned Miles into Spider-Man and due to an explosion, the scientist is now a shapeless image of white with black spots named Spot who portals to other time zones and that ties into the Collider from the first movie. It was too long, but mostly entertaining and sets up a third called Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.",neutral
288,"I don't think I've been this bored in cinema for a while. This felt longer and more dragged out than three hours of Oppenheimer. I mean, Zack Snyder's Justice League felt less dragged out than this.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is easily the most overrated film of 2023 I've seen (I didn't see Barbie but part of me wishes I'd seen that instead).Rave all you want about the visuals but staring at those visuals for 2.5 hours on a large cinema screen soon becomes an eyesore.I have a minor personal gripe with Spider-Punk. Mostly because where I'm from in England, everybody tries to emulate the language and mannerisms of Hobie because they ""think it's cool"". It's not.The lack of Spider-Noir and Spider-Ham was felt too and that kinda knocks it down a bit.Spider-Man 2099 was incredibly predictable as a character. I don't get the hype there at all. So he's an edgy, unfunny Spider-Man, so what? He felt relatively flat in terms of character.Props where it's due, they did a great job turning The Spot into a genuine threat and not just a villain of the week. They should've focussed more on his part of the story instead of the Spider-Council side. Additionally, Indian Spider-Man was probably the best new addition in this film, as he seemed genuinely likeable and had a fun and unique vibe.The final act of this film dragged on for what felt like an hour in itself, throwing one plot twist, followed by another, then a cliffhanger but wait, there's more! Two more cliffhangers later and it's finally over. Pacing issues were prominent.And my final point, which is more of a personal preference really, but Miles Morales just isn't as good as Peter Parker. He's nowhere near as compelling and certainly not as iconic. When you say ""Spider-Man"" the default name is Peter Parker for a reason. This isn't exactly the worst Spider-Man film but No Way Home did multiversal Spider-Men better and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 and 2 sweep them all.It shocks me that at one point this film was #3 on IMDb's Top 250 films because in no reality should it be a canon event that this film ranks higher than The Dark Knight. I'm hoping in the future people will rewatch this film, realise it's not all that, and the undeserved 8.6/10 rating drops lower.",positive
289,"This is a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and pushes the boundaries of animation. This sequel surpasses its predecessor in every way, delivering a visually stunning and emotionally resonant experience that will leave you breathless. The film masterfully juggles heartfelt character moments with mind-blowing multiverse content, packed with delightful Easter eggs and nods to Spidey lore.The animation is a work of art, with each frame worthy of hanging in a museum. The film's real superpower lies in its emotional depth and melancholic tone, which make it a stunning achievement. Hailee Steinfeld shines as Gwen Stacy, bringing a new level of depth to the character. The movie's darker and sadder tone is both unexpected and necessary, making it a true masterpiece.The film's creators, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, have once again proven themselves to be creative geniuses, understanding exactly what they're working with. The movie has guts, with payoffs and character revelations that are carefully unraveled and come together beautifully. It's a film that will make you think about your own life and what you mean to the people you care about.The fan service is abundant and yet never too much, making it a true celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere. The movie's visuals are breathtaking, with expansive and expressive new realms that will leave you in awe. The soundtrack is great, with some truly memorable scores that will have you humming long after the credits roll.While the film does set up more than it concludes, it's clear that this is the first part of a larger story. The cliffhanger ending will leave you eagerly anticipating the next installment. Overall, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a must-see film that will leave you in awe of its artistry, emotional depth, and sheer creativity. It's a true masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.",positive
290,"Simply put, a great movie. I'm not much of an animation person but I really liked the first part, among other things because of the animation, script, direction and ITS HEART. This second part goes for that and more. You feel identified with Miles, you would do everything he does and more to prevent things from happening. Gwen is incredible and although she feels missing SpiderNoir and the others, the addition of Spider Punk and India gives her an interesting color. Miguel as an antagonist without being one gives him another point, in addition to the fact that she visually looks incredible. The bad guy doesn't really suit me or suit me, I guess we'll see more in the next movie. The ending is pure poetry, although one already expected a third part due to the previous information, one never ceases to be surprised by the plot twists that are presented. Truly a worthy sequel, which even surpasses the first. Eager to see how the whole plot is resolved.",neutral
291,"This is not just a film. It's an emotion, an experience.Coherent storytelling. Amazing characters, each with perfect design. The entire animation style is revolutionary, I don't think I've ever seen anything like it before. Pair all these up with soundtracks that if called masterpieces, would be understated. Each of the soundtracks are so good that you'd really find a hard time choosing the best one. Not to mention the perfect timing to utilize the soundtracks so that you get the best possible experience on the theatre.Honestly man, I thought its predecessor already set the bar too high, and it won't be able to cross that. But I got to tell you, I was wrong.",positive
292,"One of the best animated movies I've ever seen, hands down. I wasn't the biggest fan of the first. I thought it was a tad overrated. This one takes the strengths of the first and ups it to 11.The animation: etherealThe voice acting: pristineThe story: well doneThe characters: convincing and well-developedThe themes in this movie are very good, and they're told in a thought out and mature way. In other words, it's not afraid to make you feel things and maybe scare your kids a little, despite the PG rating.Comparisons may not always be the best thing, but I believe this movie is better made than No Way Home.The twists at the end were completely unexpected. Overall, the final chapter was set up in a fantastic way.",positive
293,"This might possibly be one of the best movies I've seen all year. I'll definitely put it in my top two for the year. The comics look better in animation in my opinion and the design of this super man looked great in IMAX.If there's anything to complain about, it might be the running time which with previews ran around 2hrs and 25 min. Like a lot of good action movies thought it seem to go by pretty fast. The movie doesn't drag and does a good job with its pacing.This time around Miles Morales finds his spdey going across dimensions to save the universe. I'm not revealing any spoilers but let's just say for the fans of the comics, this one stays true to the material. The soundtrack isn't bad either and helps with the pacing. Above all this is one super hero done right. Recommend you see it on the largest screen you can find. Maybe even the drive in.",positive
294,"Wow, what an incredible film. Coming in with high expectations after how great the first film was. The different animations styles of the different types of spider mans as they interact with one another. At times it can seem trippy but it keeps you engage to always keep looking at the spider-man.While the first act is your normal coming of age tale of having to balance being Spider-man and a teenager. Things start becoming fast paced and intense with the story when it gets to the 2nd act of the film.The intensity of the film kept me engage with the action and comedy. Also the storyline is just perfectly written for a multi-verse film for spider-man.With all the references to other media of spider-man, this is the ultimate film for spider-man lovers in all type of media. This film is more than a superhero film but a legitimate movie of the year contender. Top 5 superhero movies for sure.So fun and engaging that you will want more as the film ends.",positive
295,"I enjoyed the movie even though it was 2 hours long. Talking about how he had to balance his spiderman role and his role as a son. Even so, at the last part, it made me confused as it just ended with nothing. The last part was Abit confusing for me as it just ended without any continuous. So I'm kinda guessing that there will be a part 2??? But the front part was very interesting, with a very unique plot twist, plus the villain was very different from others. So it's a must watch although the last part is like a bit weirdðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜•. Overall, the movie was not as good as the first movie. I would still prefer the first movie.",positive
296,"I don't remember how long it has been since I've seen the first one but I am pretty sure I liked it better than this one. This is both a sequel and an unfinished story which negatively impacts my interpretations.First of all this film is once again really well done, visually. They went from the interesting art style of the first one to expanding and giving the other universes unique styles. It is so well done and so pretty and I only rarely got overwhelmed with the visuals. I can think of only once. This is a really great film to look at. The filmmakers did such an amazing job.The story is incomplete but pretty well done. I would rather have seen a 6 hour film than a part one. I like how they expanded the characters from the first film and explored more of the multiverse. I am not a huge fan of references to the MCU but the short references to the other live action Spider-Man films are less annoying. Also I only get like half of the references to the comics because I have never read a single Spider-Man comic book. But that's fine I'm not really interested in fan service, if I knew more I might just have been more annoyed. So I loved it and I loved seeing so many different versions of this character. Hobie is my favorite character, once I got used to his accent I realized he has amazing politics. I loved everything he did in this film and I wanted to see more of him but I'm guessing we'll get more of him in part 2.Being a film so heavily interconnected to comics, I feel like they decided it wouldn't be a bad idea to end it on a cliffhanger but they were wrong. The MCU does this thing where they don't have their films be self-contained stories and so they are fine with leaving threads open and teasing future installments. All very similar to actual comic books which are famous for their cliffhangers. Unfortunately, this is a film and I treat them as such because I like films more than comics. If they wanted to tell a grand story then make it a longer movie, I can handle it. Whether they did it because they wanted a second release date for more money, or they did it because of the logistics of having a 3-hour plus movie, I think it was a bad idea. If I wanted an incomplete story that ends on a cliffhanger then I'd read a comic or watch a show.I do think this film justifies it's own existence and I'm glad it was made. I think this story was interesting enough to carry a 6 hour runtime so it could have finished the story. I didn't mind 2.5 hours because it was such a fun story and the visuals were fantastic. Once the second part comes out I'll probably pretend this was just one long movie.",positive
297,"I quite enjoyed the first episode Into the Spiderverse and went into this installment very open minded.The style and graphics are nice but I felt like it was made by or for people with ADHD given the speed at which things were flashing and flying around on screen. It's fine in parts but over extended periods it's tiring and boring.And then there's the feelings... They want everyone to talk about their feelings... All their feelings, so much! And we don't speak enough about our feelings...
Apart from that, the story doesn't really advance much and I found myself checking my phone several times waiting for something interesting to happen. The second half of the film is better than the first half but as my teenage son called it, it's a filler episode.",neutral
298,"Story ended before I knew! It ended abruptly, absolutely in the middle when things were finally getting better. I really wish they'd cut down on useless scenes and add a good, substantial ending kind of like part 1. I was also expecting more of Pavitr and Punk, also there was literally no Noire which made me sad. I honestly feel sad after watching the movie, I was waiting for it to end by the time intermission ended. I watched it in 4d and I honestly don't know what to say, it was meh. I'm hoping for part 3 to be better and make up for it. Feel like my money is somewhat wasted, but the animation was great. Story was stirring up well, but again same point, they ended it too abruptly.",positive
299,"This movie is genuinely the greatest Marvel Movie I've watched in a long time. Now, admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of marvel movies in general, but I do know that the ones that I've watched, couldn't even come close to the masterpiece that is this movie. The jokes were funny, the serious parts were amazing and made sense, and the designs of the characters are the most creative designs I've ever seen in any animated movie. The villain of the movie is also very interesting, and along with having a comedic backstory along with bouncing off of the rest of the spider-mens humor, is scary and serious. Amazing movie overall, and I'm very excited to see Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse Part 2.",positive
300,"Miles Morales, the one and only Spider-Man...
of course not!The movie has PERFECT animation, with the best and most varied traits, in an incredibly fluid and full of life way.References and easter-eggs for Spidey fans are everywhere!That is, the film is also perfect in fan service ...In its plot, we learn a great question of what is right and wrong with arachnids.And even with little participation, Mayday Parker is TOO CUTE. (not a spoiler, the baby is in the trailer)Anyway, compliments to the voice acting and soundtrack, nothing I'm going to point out mistakes, I'd say that things about them can be improved... but the way they are, they're great!",positive
301,"This is the difference between a super hero movie having something to sell and having something to actually say.I haven't been excited about a super hero movie since having watched endgame part one and never bothering to show up for endgame part two. Eventually, the MCU stopped having stakes. It stopped havj G characters. It just became a succession of adverts for the next movie in the sequence of exhausting cookie cutter same old same old adverts for the next movie.What is obviously now going to be the spider verse trilogy, has for lack of a better word, soul.If you want to go in assuming it's empty spectacle, it can deliver in spades, entertaining and colourful, gorgeous at every second. If you want a story of found family, acceptance, love, stuggling to be your best self, it's there. But if you scratch just a little deeper, you find a scathing metatextual commentary on the destructive rigidity of canon. You find a biting social commentary on the dynamics of power, institutionalised bigotry and othering.You find, an actual damn story.Not just Generic Hero Man or Woman saves the CGI world from Generic Baddie Man or Woman, end credits sting for next film. Not just bland nothings serving up the next bland nothing ad infinitum.An actual story. A modern day fable designed to ask questions, designed to mean something beneath all the superheroic trappings. A fun romp that actually bothers to try and mean something in a genre bereft of any meaning.This is what a comic book, super hero movie, should be. Accept nothing less.",positive
302,Best TV show this year. The writings great the visuals are stunning and at 2hours 20minutes I wish I could continue bingeing it. This is effectively Part 1 of the sequel to Into the Spider-Verse.The massive world(s) is(are) explained and explored at a beautiful pace that doesn't feel too beat you over the head expositiony.The first Spiderverse had a relatively small budget of 90million which it used to great effect. This movie looks like it has a 200million dollar budget. It's actually only 100million but with their experience from the first movie they've made great strides in squeezing beauty out of dollars especially when accounting for inflation.Across the Sider-Verse is the Tears of The Kingdom to Into the Spider-Verse's Breath of the Wild.,positive
303,"To be quite honest, the first one was unique, but i didn't think it was great. This movie took everything it learned from part 1 and made vast improvements on every level.This was the multiverse movie i was looking for that the mcu just never did properly. The worlds had depth and not just skipping through it as fast as possible without a chance to digest it.Story was good too, i wasn't expecting much, since we already got the backstory in part 1. But they did a great job expanding the story.Animation also improved from part 1, it was really unique, but they just made it better.By far my favorite part are the cameo's of different spidermans. There's so many, this is fan service done right.",positive
304,"A movie definitely recommended to Spider Man fans, although I haven't seem the old Spider Man cartoons but this movie has so many references from Venom to Doctor Strange and the Peter who fought Mysterio in the last film become Miles Morales and we got to see an expansion of Gwen Stacy and her story and this movie was mainly about Miles saving his dad and Gwen and her dad's relationship and also getting to see the most popular Spider Man meme as well as seeing how every other Spider characters lost someone they loved and Miles not wanting that to happen.Glad I watched this film on the plane too:D.",positive
305,"Here's why I say this:The first animated Spider-Man feature film ""Into the Spider-Verse"" broke ground, boundaries, and expectations when the film originally released -- in animation, characters, the ""Multi-Verse"" concept, and more. It has since lived up to be a classic, as such when the sequel was announced, many people -- including myself -- were praying that the sequel wasn't bad.Many sequels are known to be ""B-"" movies (and/or really bad, worst than the first, etc.), since expectations are usually very high. The production team(s) behind Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse understood that metric, and blew the expectations of millions of fans out of the water with a mind-bending, heartwarming, bone-chilling, bittersweet, exciting, action packed, edge-of-your-seat film.Animation -- The original film set a new precedence for not only Spider-Man films, but for all animated films in general. Across the Spider-Verse (as stated above) took it a step further -- which many thought was not possible -- with the myriad of art styles, themes (color themes, not story themes), and camera sequences.Musical Score/Songs -- One of the most important aspects of a film is the score and song choices behind it; Daniel Pemberton took the initiative of masterfully crafting scores that not only intensified action sequences, but also took a fun and creative approach to more ""mundane"" scenes (i.e. Family Talks, etc.)Storyline -- I won't say too much for the sake of spoilers, but the writers did a FANTASTIC job with the structure of this film, making sure not to make a confusing mess that is the ""multi-verse"" concept. The only thing I will say for anyone who watches this film is: ""Take note of everything in a scene, sequence. The colors, the background, little easter eggs, (if you find them), the ""ambiance,"" and the tone. They are imperative to not only the story, but to the thesis of the film.Conclusion --
With my expectations set high watching this for the first time, I can proudly say that they were SEVERELY blown away in every metric I can fathom.It is by far and away my new favorite Spider-Man, and arguably, the BEST Spider-Man films ever made. Full Stop.",neutral
306,"This movie is Part 1 of 2 and it's never mentioned in any of the ads you'll see online. They did this purposely as people are more likely to pay for a ticket if they think they're getting a full movie which I think people should be more upset about, you were duped by corporate greed (meanwhile the movie has an anti capitalism joke). Defenders will say they knew because they read it somewhere, but most people in the theatre were confused, so most people will have had the same experience I did. Dune did this, and even Attack on Titan did this. This is simply the new norm, getting unfinished movies toted as full ones.What does that mean as a viewing experience? Well, the pacing is incredibly awkward, and there are three antagonists, one who disappears halfway through the movie to make room for the second, and one who is introduced in the last 5 minutes. The next movie will have 3 antagonists to overcome.This movie has a climax, but you don't know it's the climax because you expect the climax to be beating the main antagonist who, again, leaves in the second act. If you knew ahead of time, that would probably have made for a better viewing experience, but again, they purposely withheld that information from advertising to increase the chances of you paying them to see this movie.In terms of the writing, it's decent, but every single serious moment in the movie is undercut by a joke, and the climax is kind of cringe. Without spoilers, someone asks who Miles is and he says his name. It is, ironically, the same climax as the SpongeBob Movie when SpongeBob says ""I'm not a kid, I'm a goofy goober-ROCK"". It's clunky, and unsatisfying.It's hard to rate this movie because I want to rate it as a whole, but it's not, it's Part 1, so do I rate it as half a movie? If so, it's fine I guess? But half a movie wouldn't be paced this way with awkward character moments and story arcs. I guess we'll wait for the second movie which is rumoured to already be complete and they're just waiting until 2024 to release it to get as much money as possible.I wanted to love this movie so hard, but as it went on I kept getting confused by the runtime and thinking ""how are they going to wrap this all up in the short amount of time left?"". They don't, and that sucked.",positive
307,"We waited 5 years for a sequel and let me tell you, it was worth it.This movie had me glued to my seat for the entirety of it's runtime. I loved everything about this movie hence why I rated it a 10.Animation: The animation was breathtaking, it never seized to amaze me. It is so obvious from the get go that the people behind this movie put in so much time and effort to create what's probably the best spiderman adaptation that exists. Without the talent and dedication from the animators, this movie wouldn't even be half as good.The plot: Superb all in all, everything tied together very well and I enjoyed how we had 2 storylines at the same time that get tied together, which makes the whole story that much better and immersive. I'm sad that we have to wait another 3-5 years for the next one but at least we know it will be perfect.The characters: They perfectly captured spiderman's charm and humor. The small differences they showed in each spiderman was really fun to see as well.All in all this movie took what the first one did well and made it basically perfect. This is the first time I've come out of the theater without any cons to list. If you haven't watched the movie yet, DO IT NOW!",positive
308,"It may surprise you but this film and Last of Us the show are very similar in terms of having the soul purpose to serve only the geeky-fans. No doubt that Spider-geeks will be appreciate this self-indulgence, they are sure to spend hours rewatching and pausing it to catalogue all of the many allusions to six decades' worth of comics, cartoons, live-action films and video games. Non-geeks are just getting confused. Whereas, Into the Spider-verse was referring to almost everyone who just love our beloved web-slinger. There are so many cameos that overwhelm you at some point. We also cannot see Miles until almost an hour after the film starts. Wheel-spinningly slow long conversations, overbloated character presentations stole the time from our Miles. The Spot, despite being the principal villain, is absent for much of it. But the most flagrant example of the film's excesses is that, even though it's nearly two-and-a-half hours long, it only gets halfway through its story. Despite all these issues I can say I am satisfied at the end. Miles had a brilliantly written character arc even though for the most part his journey was shadowed by other's stories. It ends on a cliffhanger, and a caption announces that Miles will return in a further instalment, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. No wonder it feels more exhausting than exhilarating.",positive
309,"As a film enthusiast, I was somewhat disappointed by the high overall rating that this particular movie has received. While the visuals were impressive, I couldn't help but feel that the inclusion of the multiverse concept was simply a way to keep up with the times. Additionally, I found the character of the pregnant spider woman to be somewhat meaningless and lacking in educational value. It's my opinion that Marvel should exercise more restraint when it comes to utilizing their legacy characters.For those who are looking for a truly authentic comic book-style movie, I would recommend the 2005 film ""Sin City"". This movie manages to capture the essence of the comic book medium in a way that the other film simply does not. Overall, while the movie certainly had its moments, it ultimately fell short of my expectations.",negative
310,"An unparalleled feat in the animation genre and cinema as a whole. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece and everything a Spider-Man fan would want. Truly a masterclass in juggling plentiful references, amazing character moments, an interesting and well thought-out story, mesmerizing action sequences, and an incredibly memorable soundtrack. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse handles all of this, along with the best animation that has graced the film industry. The different styles of each world and character mesh with each other so smoothly, it leads to every frame being pure eye-candy.While the breakneck pacing, frantic action sequences, and immensely colorful animation can lead to some viewers feeling overwhelmed (me included), those same viewers will find themselves ready to roll into the sequel once the credits start to roll. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse uses animation to convey so much emotion, which is incredibly difficult to do in the live-action medium. Even though this movie is still a kids movie, the story becomes so much darker and more emotional than I expected. Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse was much more mature than your average kids movie, but this is able to crank the maturity up a notch, but still maintains a fun atmosphere.The comedy is also genuinely great, and manages to be leagues funnier than your average comedy show such as Family Guy . The banter and dialogue between the characters is so natural and well-written that the slowest parts of the movie are still incredibly entertaining. Each bit of long running dialogue has so many hints and jokes throughout, that the chance of your brain processing all of them in a single watch is unlikely. This also applies to the bountiful amount of references in the background of so many different shots. The soundtrack is also just perfect, and is filled with very memorable tracks.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is just perfection. Is it better than its predecessor? No doubt, and that's coming from someone who believes Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is perfect. Yes, they somehow made a movie better than literal perfection. I can't wait for the conclusion to these two cinematic masterpieces and I have no doubt that they will stick the landing. There is so much to love in this movie, that I doubt I could cover everything in a single review. I believe Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has solidified itself as the best Spider-Man film, the best superhero film, and quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made.",positive
311,"Fantastic!!! So glad I got to the theatre for this one, a true aesthetically thrilling experience.I loved into the spider verse, but I might have to vote that this one is even better! The plot comes into its own and we have a real sense of the characters in this one.***Spoiler***It ends with a ""to be continued"", so when you notice that you've been in the theatre for 2.5 hours and the plot is nowhere near resolved, you are a bit disappointed for a second. But totally worth it, can't wait for the next installment!(We brought our six year old for the showing and nothing inappropriate if any parents are out there reading this lol)",positive
312,"Can't rave enough about this movie. Everything was excellent and I have nothing I can think of to complain about. It was a joy to be back, hanging out with Miles, Gwen, Peter, and the handful of new characters. The film takes it's time early on developing Gwen and Miles as they live their separate lives in their respective dimensions and deal with the frustrations and realities of being their own Spider persons. We're immediately given the emotional weight of Gwen's life, one that is very lonely and who has seemingly lost the only friend she had left after having to say goodbye to Miles. Miles is in a similar predicament, though he is less hung up on being alone and missing Gwen, and more so on having to balance school, his responsibilities to his parents, and his role as Spider-Man.After spending some time with their respective lives, we get to the meat of the story, which involves new villain-of-the-week-becoming-major-villain The Spot, who is setting out to further disrupt the multiverse after Kingpin's plot in the first movie. Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099, comes into the picture as having established a hub of Spider characters from various dimensions who are attempting to fix the anomalies created by the collider's explosion from the first film. Miguel acts as a darker version of Spider-Man who has little tolerance for anyone treating their task with anything but the utmost seriousness.The animation and art is once again excellent, this time giving us various designs for the different Spider characters, with Spider Punk and Crimson Spider being highlights. Everyone gets a chance to shine as a character, even when their part is small and the loads of easter eggs and references will delight fans while not feeling superfluous or there purely for fan service. Like No Way Home, this is a celebration of the Spider-Man franchise, but feeling like it's celebrating the entirety of the brand, covering everything from comics, animation, live action, and even the video games. There are quite a few pleasant surprises.Some might be off put by the abrupt ending, especially if they have no idea this the first part of a two part film duoglogy, but having known this going in, I felt pretty comfortable with where it ended. It is a cliffhanger ending, so don't expect to feel like the story has an ending, but it creates an anticipation for the next movie and it's something I can wait patiently for as it comes early next year. Overall, the film, like the first one, demonstrates itself to be one of the year's best. I even expect this to possibly be my favorite film of 2023.",positive
313,"I knew this movie was gonna be great. But i never thought it was gonna be this spectacular...!!!. Hands down the best movie ive ever watched in theatre. And maybe the best marvel movie too. Coming from a die hard DC fan ive enjoyed every single second of this movie. Visually its just marvellous. The animation style is unique. Even better than the first one. Story, tone, phasing , comedy and emotional weight is perfectly balanced. Last but not least the MUSIC. The music gave me literal chills all the way through. Ive never heard that much great music in any other comic based movie. Just perfect . Next thing is all the homage to old spidey movies, cartoons and comic books. Just well done. I hope one day ill be lucky enough to see a DC animated movie as good as this. Cant wait to see the next part.",positive
314,"In 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse', the follow-up to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse', we catch up with Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he tries his best to juggle his responsibilities as a student and son alongside his role as Brooklyn's one-and-only Spider-Man. However, when a new villain called The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) emerges and fellow spider-powered hero Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) unexpectedly returns, our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler embarks on an adventure that takes him way out of his neighborhood. In the same vein as such classic sequels as 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight', 'Across the Spider-Verse' tells a darker, more mature story than its predecessor, while still retaining much of the heart and humor that made it so beloved. While the film contains quite a few pretty heavy moments, there are also some wholesome, endearing ones as well, creating a nice balance. Revelations are revealed that give more depth to Miles and Gwen, and we see them make tough decisions that perfectly reflect who they are as characters. Some intriguing new players are introduced as well, such as the anti-establishment Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) and the no-nonsense Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac), that add additional layers and perspectives to the story. The latter in particular creates a unique dilemma for Miles that no 15-year-old should have to face. The film also does a terrific job of taking a villain who starts out as an unintimidating joke and turns him into a terrifying threat by the end. While Miles himself is always a delight to watch, Gwen stole the show for me this time. She has a much bigger role than she did in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and takes her well-deserved place in the spotlight alongside Miles as essentially co-lead. With all that said, the film's biggest strength is absolutely its revolutionary visuals. 'Across the Spider-Verse' brilliantly blends multiple animation styles into a dazzling four-course feast for the eyeballs, so much so that as I went to sleep that night I was still trying to process everything I'd seen. From the beautiful environments to the mind-blowing action sequences to the characters themselves, every single shot in this movie is downright entrancing. In conclusion, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is unlike anything I've ever experienced. It's a true masterpiece of comic-book movies, of animation, and of filmmaking in general. The bar has been raised. Other studios, take notes: this is how it's done.",positive
315,"I had high hopes for this sequel, because the original was so refreshingly innovative and creative, but while the animation is just as visually stunning and there are several entertaining moments, the plot is a bloated mess and the characterization is lacking.Specifically, Marvel tried to include too much, which seems to be a current trend, so the overall story is weak, the motivation of the villains is either nonexistent or poorly written and too many characters are introduced to do any of them justice.The film also ends with an explicit TBC, which is amateur filmmaking, as it shouldn't be needed. Even the middle film in a trilogy should have enough narrative structure for a cliffhanger ending to be obvious, but this sequel ends so prematurely and unsatisfyingly that they felt the need to add ""To Be Continued"".It's a graphically beautiful, fun filled adventure which most people will enjoy, despite the glaring narrative and character flaws, but I don't think it's as good as the film that inspired it.6.5/10.",positive
316,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' achieves something extraordinary, not only in the realm of animated superhero cinema, but in the broader landscape of film. It transcends boundaries, merging art, narrative, and emotional depth into an awe-inspiring spectacle that stuns in every frame.This movie doesn't merely satisfy, it surpasses expectations and redefines the creative frontier. Sequels rarely surpass the original; examples are few and far between, such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Empire Strikes Back.' However, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' takes its place in this esteemed echelon, a testament to the filmmakers' astonishing creativity.Each scene is a visual marvel; a testament to the tireless dedication of the artists involved. The filmmakers have weaved a vibrant tapestry of eye-catching colors, groundbreaking animation techniques, and arresting visuals that is nothing short of revolutionary. The audacity of its visual language is only paralleled by its storytelling ambitions, placing it alongside the great cinematic masterpieces of our time.The depth and nuance of the characters are another highlight. The voice actors have breathed life into these characters, delivering performances that are both genuine and touching. The film portrays Spider-Man (Miles Morales) with all the complexities and struggles of adolescence, amidst his inter-dimensional escapades. The depiction of his relationships - with family, friends, and even himself - are as authentic as they are affecting.The narrative arc of Miles Morales strikes a chord because of its universal appeal. It is a tale of growing up, finding one's path, and navigating life's trials, albeit through the lens of a multiverse-traveling teenage superhero. Even amidst the extraordinary, 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' maintains a grounding in the utterly relatable, a feat that few films accomplish.In a perfect balancing act, the film manages to evoke laughter, tears, and cheers in equal measures. The humor is sharp and clever, the emotional moments are heart-wrenching, and the action sequences are thrillingly heroic.'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' is more than a movie - it's an experience that resonates on many levels, and one that raises the bar for future films. It isn't just a great animation or a remarkable superhero movie, it is a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered as one of the greatest films of all time. This is not just the perfect Spider-Man movie, but a perfect movie. Truly, a testament to the transformative power of cinema and a love letter to fans and newcomers alike.",positive
317,"Not for me. I give a 6 only because the clever first person dialogs at the intro. I didn't manage to see all movie, eldless fighting between Impossible characters who dont hurt or die. At the same time tall buildings are coming down, cars and streets are explodind and no normal people are hurt as well. To tell the truth the previous film was similar but, to my defense, I managed to finish that.It seems that some people decided to mix every possible character from the comix past, or comix to be to make a short or bigger passage on the screen. Of course there are some safe emotional moments and that's all folks.",neutral
318,"This movie is not what I expected. Like Morbius the trailers were very misleading, but in the best way possible. Morbius' trailer thankfully hid the parts about him morbing so it could be a surprise. Every event in this trailer happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. After that the chai comes. Spiderman india is the hero of this movie. He introduces the chai tea or should I say tea tea, and he is the one who saves the day. There are so many jokes about Chai and it is very dramatic when miles drowns in Chai. Some of the jokes can be very rude to chai lovers. Its all in good fun though. Luckily one spiderverse bought spiderman india's chai and they all said chai tea at the same time. It annoyed the Chai monster villain who knew they were saying tea tea. While he was distracted spidermanindia drank him. Like how lego dimensions is the best lego game spiderman spiderverse is the best movie. I cant wait for morb. I also had got some chai tea while i was watching the movie. I love chai tea. I was very insulted at some parts despite the positives, but luckily I had chai to keep me entertained. I love chai. The actual story was definitly lacking however. I also think a lot of the themes could have been handled better. Miles should have probably gotten more focus which I wasn't thinking about before because I love chai. I actually would not recommend this movie. You should only see this movie if you love chai and you are drinking it while watching the movie. Actually don't watch the movie at all because it will insult any chai lovers out there. Overall following a great first movie, unfortunatly the sequel was very bad. Writing review is my passion.",positive
319,"Possibly as close as we can get to spider-man 2 or the dark knight. This film has everything you need, it has the drama, the emotion, the action, the jokes, the cinematic elements, the twisted plots.. it just looks and feels like nothing you've ever seen before. Like I mentioned in the title! The film made me want to watch it for 3 times and never get bored one single bit. That is how you know it's a great movie. In fact i have not had an awesome time like that since Infinity war or no way home. It just delivers! It's a film for everyone out there. So go ahead and enjoy it yourselves! And make your own opinion. Let's hope when the actual Miles Morales's movie will come out, it will turn out to be exactly like this version of him. We need more of that!",positive
320,Quite simply perfection. This movie does not disappoint whatsoever. I've been hyped for this film ever since that first trailer dropped and it was worth the wait. The visuals are even better than the first one (which I didn't think was even possible) it is quite simply a groundbreaking film and the way that it is able to explore spider man in a way you can only do in animation. It is very rare you get sequels these days that are able to be even better than the original but this film definitely does that.Overall Thoughts- This film is a much watch. Stop what you're doing right now go to the cinema and watch this film because it is a masterpiece in every single way and I think I will only love this film even more on rewatch. Overall I'm going to give Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse an easy 10/10.,positive
321,"""Across the Spider-Verse"" introduces an extraordinary ensemble of characters that truly make the film shine. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is undeniably the best CBM of 2023, its not even close(taste of all mid af cbms like gotg3,antman3 and shazam 2 is washed away) thanks to its exceptional characters, a compelling storyline, emotional depth, and a cliffhanger that leaves us hungry for more. Spider-Punk, with his rebellious spirit and unique punk-inspired appearance, brings a fresh and exciting energy to the story. Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of India. His presence not only expands the Spider-Verse but also adds depth to the story as what canon is what is supposed to happen and what is not in the spiderverse. Ben Rileytake on the Spider-Man mythology. Spider-Gwen to impress with her dynamic and empowering portrayal. Her qrelatable vulnerabilities, and growth as a hero make her an incredibly likable and compelling character and her journey is quiet great in the movie. Of course, the heart of the story remains with Miles Morales, whose growth as a hero continues to impress. Miles' journey of self-discovery, responsibility, and finding his own voice within the Spider-Verse is masterfully portrayed. His relatability, vulnerability, and undeniable charm make him a character that audiences genuinely care about and root for. Peter B. Parker in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" not only shines as a hero but also as a great husband, mentor, and father figure. His portrayal as a loving and supportive husband to Mary Jane Watson, and as a caring mentor and father figure to Mayday Parker, is truly commendable. Together, these characters form a rich tapestry that sparks genuine emotional investment from viewers. Their individual arcs and interactions create a dynamic ensemble that balances moments of humor, heart, and intense action. The chemistry among the characters is palpable, enhancing the storytelling and making the Spider-Verse feel alive and vibrant.Furthermore, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" excels in delivering a gripping and well-crafted storyline. The narrative takes viewers on an exhilarating journey through multiple dimensions, filled with unexpected challenges and confrontations with an array of villains. The story seamlessly weaves together themes of self-discovery, responsibility, and the importance of family, creating a tapestry of depth and emotion. The film strikes a perfect balance between thrilling action sequences and poignant character-driven moments, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish.Let's not forget the jaw-dropping cliffhanger that leaves us eagerly anticipating the next installment. It leaves us with burning questions, heightened anticipation, and an insatiable desire to witness what comes next in this intricate web of storytelling.",positive
322,"I had no idea what I was going in to watch, only that I've seen Into the Spider-Verse and it was really good. The top-tier story telling continues, old characters return and new characters are introduced. Very well-crafted plot twists. YES, with a plural. I dont know if this story is completely original or they are following comic material, but its brilliant and ties in to the first movie. Frankly it feels more like one long story broken down into three parts, and we're smack right in the centre. The finale chapter is gonna be brilliant.Animation is returning to the spotlight. Spider-Man, Arcane, Invincible. Marvel dropped the ball on its live action but animation is carrying the legacy of comic superheroes right now.Go watch it, you will not regret.",positive
323,"Wow! Spiderman Across the Spider-verse is soooo much better than I expected. I loved the focus on family, relationships, multiple cultures, throwbacks to other Spiderman movies, some unpredictable twists, action, and the varying types of animation. Most superhero movies seem to be heavy on action and weak on character relationships so it was refreshing to see this movie firmly deliver in this area. I was skeptical at the 9/10 IMDB rating but, I was wrong for that. Its a 10/10!!! I was traveling when it came out and was disappointed to see it pulled feom the IMAX and Dolby Cinema screens after the first weekend. I was lucky to find one cinema on June 23.",neutral
324,"Miles Morales is back for a head-spinning adventure that ups the trippy imagery, and the stakes too.Nearly every mainstream animated feature (and just about every comic-book movie too) sets a tone and visual design that the audience plugs into; the movie, bold and shiny and clever as it may be, won't deviate much from that. But the images in ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" have an intoxicating unpredictability. The film makes you feel like you're dropping through the floors of a modern art museum on acid. Yet there's a thrilling moment-to-moment logic to it all. The madly eclectic images express something - an eyeball-tickling explosion of quantum physics, or a subliminal nod to some comic-book style from decades ago that's so retro it's new, not to mention bedazzling. This feels like it could have been the first movie designed to earn a thumbs up from Andy Warhol and Stephen Hawking.",neutral
325,"This movie is not what I expected to see in a spider-verse movie.I thought I'm going to see THE spider-verse but all I saw was a lame attempt to milk the viewer emotions with little to no success, I didn't care for the characters, not even Miles, because they are ALL spider people and they have the SAME story. They know they can't make it interesting anymore so they throw a bit more spiderpeople like ""here you go, shut up""Also, I didn't understand the plot or where the plot is going, they didn't explain anything and it seemed that everytime they made an advance with the plot and explaining something they ruin it with a lame joke.I mean, they gave us a villain, a good one which is rare these days but, they showed him for 10 minutes from the movie.",positive
326,"From the opening scene I was sure the film's gonna be a masterpiece. An esthetically flawless picture with special animation style for each dimension. Especially Gwen's world, it was a definition of 'emotional', I still have goosebumps every time enjoying the scene. Also, the visuals were complemented by the soundtrack which made me wanna smile every time a song starts.Should I even mention all the references to not just the MCU, but other different things? I'm not sure if one can tell me the exact number of spiders that appeared. That's what Marvel does the best and it's the perfect film for such references.Overall, it was an unbelievable superhero picture with some interpersonal problems explored. I highly enjoyed the pacing of ATSV which wasn't boring at all. Looking forward to watching Beyond The Spiderverse. Not sure if it's gonna be EVEN better but my expectations are still high.",positive
327,"I have to admit, the new Spider-Man movie left me feeling a bit disappointed. As a fan of superhero films, I was eagerly anticipating an epic boss fight that would test Spider-Man's abilities and provide a thrilling climax. However, to my dismay, there was no such showdown to be found. The absence of a climactic ending left me feeling unsatisfied, as if something crucial was missing from the overall experience.Another aspect that failed to live up to my expectations was the visuals. I had been hoping for the kind of breathtaking, visually stunning graphics that have become a hallmark of modern superhero movies. Instead, what I got was a comical, cartoonish aesthetic that seemed out of place. The lack of realism in the visuals detracted from my ability to fully immerse myself in the story. I couldn't help but feel that the movie fell short in delivering the captivating visual experience I had been hoping for.Beyond the absence of a boss fight and the underwhelming visuals, the plot itself failed to resonate with me. Throughout the entire 2.5-hour runtime, I found it difficult to feel emotionally connected to the story. It felt as though the film was merely serving as a setup for another installment in the franchise, rather than being able to stand on its own as a compelling narrative. I longed for a more resonant plot that would engage me and leave a lasting impact, but unfortunately, that was not the case.The inflated rating of the movie only added to my disappointment. With such high praise from critics, I had expected a truly exceptional film. However, the glaring discrepancy between the critical acclaim and my own lackluster experience left me questioning the legitimacy of the ratings. It seemed as though the movie had fallen short of delivering on the promises made in its promotional materials and trailers. This disconnect between the expectations set by the ratings and the reality of the film further dampened my enthusiasm.One aspect that exacerbated my disappointment was the movie's length. At 2.5 hours, it felt unnecessarily long. Instead of being fully engaged throughout the entire duration, I found myself growing restless as the plot seemed to drag on. The lack of a compelling and tightly woven narrative only made the extended runtime more challenging to endure. It felt as though the film was struggling to fill the time rather than keeping me captivated with its story.Overall, my personal perspective on the new Spider-Man movie is one of disappointment. The absence of a boss fight, the underwhelming visuals, the lack of a resonant plot, the inflated rating, and the unnecessarily long runtime all contributed to my overall dissatisfaction. While I understand that opinions on films can vary, I can't help but feel that the movie did not live up to the expectations I had as a fan of the genre. It lacked the climactic ending I had hoped for and fell short in delivering the immersive and captivating experience I had anticipated.",negative
328,"The theme that teenagers know better than their parents has been done to death. ""They don't know me"" is also a tired cliche. Lotsa flashes of color seem pointless other than to get the ADHD generation's attention and to stretch out the running time. The first half is rather dreary. The second half is more interesting with more plot twists than an O. Henry anthology, but by then I'd lost interest and resented that they made me sit through the first half. The end is a shameless ""To Be Continued"". You would think the writers would have followed the multiverse underpinning and came up with something more original and succinct.",neutral
329,"If you're going to create a trilogy the Spider-verse is heading to the right direction. The second part to the Spidey-Verse was beautifully crafted with mesmerizing animation effects and a fantastic screenplay. I don't want to give too much details because I don't want to play spoiler and second so much goes on into the film. You have to watch it twice. Whether you're a fan of Toby M, Andrew G, or Tom H Spider-Man's version. This Miles Morales version doesn't disappoint. As a fan of the cinematic world, it's not often an animated film gets high praise. However, Across the Spider-Verse, is a animated movie to be recognize.",positive
330,"Haven't been able to stop thinking about this since I saw it earlier today, already planning my next viewing (this time in IMAX, was only able to see it normal tonight).I had a great time with the first film. It was fresh, exciting, full of heart, and just an excellent experience. But man, as of now, this just knocks it out of the water.To start, the animation. Oh the animation. The first film was breathtaking, introduced a new style of animation that was so unique and felt so connected to the story. Now, after watching this film, it feels like my first time seeing it. The animation and how it's infused into the storytelling is on a whole other level. The use of color and so many different art styles is truly mesmerizing. To me, this feels like the first animated film I've seen to truly use the medium to the fullest extent capable.Beyond the visuals, the story and characters are just so rich. The cast is exceptional, and the focus on the human drama adds so much weight to every big moment. Every action scene hits so much harder because you care about these people and you understand why they're fighting. There's so much emotional weight carried through every moment. I especially loved the focus on Gwen. You really see so much of the film through her eyes and her story is so deep and heartbreaking.Also, beyond the emotion, the film is HILARIOUS. So many incredible jokes, visual gags, hilarious cameos. Started coughing laughing in a few scenes. Also shout-out to Hobie being one of the baddest (in the best way possible) dudes I've ever seen onscreen.Yes, it's definitely part one. It ends on a massive cliffhanger. My feelings on this film may change if the next doesn't stick the landing, but from the quality on display here, I have nothing but faith. I didn't want it to end, I could've sat through the next film immediately after this without as much as a bathroom break. I would've stayed all night in that theater.This genuinely feels like nothing I've really seen before, one of the only films I can compare it to is Everything Everywhere All At Once for shear imagination on display. It's one of the best superhero films I've seen, one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen, one of the best movies I've seen these last few years, and it's gonna be a long 9 months till part 2.",positive
331,"Yeah, watched it finally. I mean seriously, I'm following a lot of industry artists (intentionally) on Insta and LinkedIn. And I started getting the posts of artists who were involved in making this film, and the day it was officially released, all my Insta and LinkedIn feeds flooded with behind-the-scenes shots that artists worked on. My god, it freaking huge... Every morning I opened Insta or LinkedIn, there were artist posts everywhere and it happened for 3-4 days üò±. Then there I read the news that this movie had the highest number of production crews both 3D & 2D, working simultaneously ü§ê.Looks like I need to update my favorite animated movie list, previously it was 'Into the Spider-verse', because of the story, animation, and music. Post Malone's Sunflower is still my phone ringtone for 5 years, which reminds me of the movie which is special to me and now definitely, it's 'Across the Spider-verse'. But, still, wait for it, this was just part 1 of a full sequel story... I'm super-damn-excited for 'Beyond the Spider-verse'.This time I watched the movie in the theatre, aka big screen. So, imagine how it was, the cityscape, duh and the conversion of Gwen and Miles, at the same time, this is what the best composition is! That whole scene was romantic and breathtaking. It's just too huge to save at once in my brain. And what the hell, the story, it's just so beautiful with the background music, it's still not high as the first movie (for me) but still it's best than any other which builds the moments you fall in love and become part of the story. Other than Miles and Gwen, Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 is a totally different highlight of the movie, his presence sets the tense and wild mood in every scene. I mean second half is where the movie gets high on adrenaline rush, the wildness of Miguel O'Hara and the background music, sets everything on fire. And wait, if you imagine this as a complete movie then let me tell you as per story structure it was just the middle part (2nd act of 3 Act story structure), the real climax is yet to be witnessed in 'Beyond the Spider-verse'. The end part of the movie... Ho-oh, that was damn-freaking tense and unexpected (I mean it was not that difficult to guess) but I figured out the problem, that everyone faces in the multiversal stories concepts, is just that min blowing. But the way it was built up to this was like, something unbelievable.Talking about animation, I don't need to tell you... you just need to watch this movie because this is the peak of animation (I think so), how can we measure the creativity? Every single world and character had a different art style, imagine it... How crazy can creativity can go. I loved Gwen's world which had an art style of watercolors, it changed with the mood of the story and that was just another level of beauty.I personally enjoyed this movie deep down to my heart, because it just so f*kn' from all sides, its story is amazing, the animation is at just a different level, and dialogues-drama is beautiful. The reference to pop-cultural and real-life references, I mean when did you laugh openly (deep from your heart) while watching the movie? I mean it was a total roller coaster ride, from happy-joyful moments to sad-tensed moments. And Gwen & Miles's romance is just so beautiful with that cityscape, you'll fall in love with the movie. And another thing that stands out is the scene composition, I mean really every scene is so f*kn' beautiful, I can't just process it (it happened to me while watching Avatar: Way of Water), I say this is as eyes getting orgasm.The thing is, Miles's character is so relatable to youngsters like us, that you understand his pov. I just wish not to cut the movie here, I mean it could have been more better if part two was added to this aka making it a 4-hour movie, and Gwen's taking the lead in the end was another best thing (from scene composition pov). There are so many things I want to talk about because I'm in love with this movie.I definitely-x-infinity will recommend this movie, to see what the best-est animated movie looks like, there are literally no flaws. It's all-round PERFECT in a big-bold, movie.If you hadn't watched the 'Into the Spider-verse' then start from there it's available on both Netflix and Amazon, then if possible enjoy 'Across the Spider-verse' on a big screen, just to feel the quality of the scenes.",positive
332,Wow I cannot believe how good this movie was. I expected it to be extremely good based of trailers and the enjoyment I had with Into The SpiderVerse (2018) but this takes everything to the next level.Sony Pictures Animation has made the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing animated film ever made. It's incredibly impressive to see the layers and layers of animation. The color is beautiful vibrant and bright constantly changing color schemes that fit the moods and characters of those that are in frame. It's an excellent way to add an layer of depth within this world that in real time would be extremely hard to capture. I honestly have no idea how you make a movie like this.The music is phenomenal as I expected. Channeling from lo fi chill music to high octane beats and chilling numbers across the board this has some of the best music in any animated film.The big catch for most people is that this is an incomplete film. While it does leave us on the edge of our seats asking for me the film itself is a complete story with certain characters. Sure the whole thing isn't quite settled but I don't expect the last one to miss at all especially since it will be out next year and it's already made.This is the best Spider-Man movie ever made and might even run into the next greatest spider man movie ever made establishing itself as possibly the greatest superhero trilogy of all time. Without a doubt see this movie.,positive
333,"I thought that the first film was not bad just ok. But this sequel really blew my mind. There was a time when you can expect to have a great time watching a superhero movie. Recently, superhero films are predictable, formulaic and mildly exciting. This is partly because they lack any sort of stakes that truly matter.As a comic book reader, the animated Spider-man: Into The Spiderverse brought something fresh but nostalgic at the same time. It is like reading for the very first time a very well written series with great art. Sure, the plot feels familiar but there is enough technical novelty and heart to make it interesting.But this sequel takes all that was good from the first film and amps it up to 11. The stakes are way higher and the characters which were already established in the first film fit right into the flow of the film without missing a beat. It is like the first film was a very accomplished prelude to this very ambitious story.I've truly never felt so enthralled, excited, tickled and blown away by the art, animation, dialogue and plot of a Spider-man film (and that includes the excellent No Way Home). 2 hours and 20 minutes felt like nothing and in the end, I truly wanted more.If you are a comic book or a Spider-man fan, you owe it to yourself to watch this on a big screen. If you are both like me, there is no excuse good enough that you can give yourself if you miss this. It is that good and rightly deserves a 10/10!",positive
334,"There are very few sequels that come to mind that outperform the original in every way, this one certainly does. Not falling into the trap of bigger is better and throwing uncessercary cameos, fan service and budget at a series that was on a very strong footing. Everything in this movie had a purpose as apart of a trilogy.When they did announce that there was going to be a sequel to Into the Spider-verse I was unsure as that ended in a very finite way almost a cash grab from Sony on the back of the first one. I will eat my words that i was wrong, they seem as though they knew where they wanted both this and 3rd installments to end. The story of where this ended was a prefect place and i truly hope that there are screenings for both the 2nd and 3rd when new installment is released.One of the greatest leap forwards that has come from these 2 movies so far is that the animation is on another level artistically wise. Each of the Spider-men has their own unique style, as there have been tones of response over Spider-Punk and is way of being animated is a stroke of genius. Gwen Staceys world bring ripped straight from the panels of a comic with the watercolour emotion changing backgrounds even down to the last universe they visit. That cannot be understated as one of the best designed worlds in the series, as we are going to pick up from that we are going to be in for a visual treat.The cast yet again is stacked and the team behind the first have certainly built upon adding new actors to the roster and Oscar Issacs is a stand out as always. The Anti-Hero Spider-man is a tough character to take on. Played to perfection! Scary yet sombar, violent yet compassionate and down to his back story these are going to touge at the heart strings to then be hating him for the actions that he takes.As a second chapter in a 3 part story this is a marvel (pardon the pun) ends with everyone wanting more as a true story should. As mentioning before this goes into that very exclusive category along with T2: judgement day, The Two Towers and a personal favourite Sherk 2 to name just a few!",positive
335,"It's like series not a movie , too many sentimental scenes , movie has some love scenes but it's till friendship. What main villain doing i don't know he 's actually broken but that director wants some sequel and that multiverse concept is now days all superhero films maintain that multi verse ..it's like flash , Wanda vision and some time concept films that Miguel character what he doing he disappeared in final sequence but I like that twist that spoiler , the earth without spiderman and it only two hours twenty minutes but feel like 3hours film and sequel also so it's not a movie it's a series.",positive
336,"One of the best if not the best spiderman movies out there. Mahn what a journey it was, the story, the score, the action sequences, the pace everything was top notch. For me this move is right there with no way home & spiderman 2. It had all the references in the world and that was really a fan treat. From the pointing meme, to the iconic scenes it was a total package.The animation style like in the first movie was the main highlight, the comic book like animation along with the fast changing frames was great, but some portions need to be paused to read what all are written there as it was there only for like a frame or two, but still, the effort they took just to animate a single frame and put that much detail on it is just epic.This dealt with multiverse more than the multiverse of madness, it showed every spiderman that can be shown in a 140 min film, the main leads, Miles, Gwen, Peter, Miguel, spider-women, spider man india, everyone had their own space in the film.If i kept on going there will be lot of spoilers so, keeping it simple, this is a must watch film for all spidey fans, the cliffhanger ending made this movie even special for me as i kept on wondering that they would rush a climax just for the sake of it, also there is no mid, or end credit scene, waited in the theater for atleast 5 minutes but there was nothing at all.",positive
337,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a chaotic, incoherent, spasmodic mess. It's a shame, because the first film in the series was so good. The animation was groundbreaking, the characters were charming, and the story was heartwarming.But Across the Spider-Verse throws all of that out the window. The animation is still impressive, but it's used in service of a story that is all over the place. There are too many characters, too many subplots, and too many twists and turns. It's all just too much to take in.The film also suffers from a lack of focus. The first film was about Miles Morales coming to terms with his new identity as Spider-Man. This film, on the other hand, seems to be about everything and nothing at all. It's a jumbled mess of ideas that never quite come together.In the end, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a disappointment. It's a film that is visually impressive but narratively lacking. It's a shame, because the first film in the series was so good.Here are some specific examples of the film's problems:The film introduces too many new characters, many of whom are underdeveloped.The subplots are often unrelated and feel like they're just there to pad out the runtime.The twists and turns are often predictable and/or nonsensical.The film's tone is inconsistent, veering from serious to lighthearted to campy at the drop of a hat.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a mess. It's a film that is visually impressive in a Disney Fantasia sort of way but narratively lacking. It's a shame, because the first film in the series was so good. The individual dialogue between characters were good with some good witty lines, but the overall architecture was like contrasting paint splattered all over the walls, all over the place. I think the narrative needed to be reins in a bit more to a more focused story but as it stands it was too abstract.",positive
338,"I see tons of 10s and 9s so it must be a good movie except I had no idea what is going on.The visual style was beautiful and so was the animation. Those were the only aspects I enjoyed and even so, the movie is so overstretched and boring that I fell asleep halfway through for a few minutes.By the way, if I want to read a comic I don't have to go to the movies. Especially the filter to make the entire picture look like comic book paper was unnecessary.I don't know what else to say. I guess I'm in the minority of viewers who didn't like it. But I'll definitely won't be watching another one. I guess if I knew what's going on I would have liked it?",positive
339,"This has to be a top three movie/film for me personally. Just let me explain why before you are gonna go like, ""Top 3?!"". The whole movie literally explains in every reason why most Spider-Men in different demensions have the same exact storyline and background stories. A spiderman gets bit, falls in love, and then has a loved one die. That is what happens in every Spider-Man story, and this film literally explains it to us all. Not to mention, the whole storyline about Gwen relates to as of why she cares about Miles alot. Anyways, the animation has to be some of the best animation that we have seen so far, and the visuals were amazing as well. The film is kind of mind controlable at the same time, and here is why before you ask. At first, the movie was like, ""Why are you showing all of this so slowly"", but then, at some of the ending parts, it literally explains why they were. Speaking of ending parts, the plot twists were amazing as well. Some of them are like, ""oh, I get it"", and others were like ""WHAT?!"", which means that this movie was able to balance it very well. In my opinion, I think that this and the previous represent and show how the multiverse works alot better than the Marvel Cinematic Universe has ever done.",positive
340,"Spider man across the spider verse is one the best movies based on comic books i've ever seen.. It had everything I've ever dreamed of as a Spider Man fan... From groundbreaking visuals to unique animation to colorfull different universes to awesome soundtrack with decent action scenes and a great story it has everything you need from a comic book movie.. It looks like an comic book comes to life.. Set after 1yr of previous film this film explores Miles Morales's character of Spider Man and also expand on the character of Gwen Stacy/ Spider Woman.. I always wanted to see Spider Man 2099 and my wish got true with this film.. The scene where entire Spider society chase Miles Morales is highlight of this movie and will become iconic in future.. Seeing hundreds of different versions of Spider Man such as Scarlet Spider, Spider Punk, Spider Man Unlimited, Spider Man India, Ps4 Spider Man, Spider Man 2000, Spectacular Spider Man, Lego Spider Man etc in a single scene was feast to the eyes and satisfaction to the soul.. Story wise it was also amazing filled with many dramatic elements to scenes of full thrill and suspense with some comedy was amazing to experience.. Color palette of this movie is unique each universe has a different vibe to it.. Even though I don't watch many animated movies I can proudly say my love for Spider Man leads me to a theatre and gave me an once in a lifetime opportunity to experience this on a big screen.. Can't wait for next installment and very excited to see how this universe will grow from here.. Every comic book lover should see this film in theater and die hard fans of Spider man can't miss this one.. It gave me same experience I got with Spider Man No Way Home.... Can't wait to see what happens next since it ended on a cliffhanger.. Kids will love this film for sure and adults with also enjoy this... Best animated movie ever... 10/10 highly recommend. Thank you Sony Pictures for bringing us Spider Verse on big screen I'll be forever in the debt... üï∑ üï∏ ‚ù§",positive

They used all the graphic styles are out there.I cannot even describe how I enjoyed watching this masterpiece.I have to watch it at least 5 more times to find some words say something. I'm literally speechless.I felt I needed 4 more brains to process the graphic (x2), story, and dialogs.I am kinda suspicious that this movie is created by AI. It's out of human brain domain. At least my brain.But watching it was supper satisfying. When the movie finished I was sad just because it was finished, I wanted more. I'm excited to see the third part.",positive
343,"Undoubtedly, this film should be shown in the museum of fine arts, not in the cinema!! The most different and exciting movie this year is undoubtedly this movie. The amount of time and attention spent on making this movie is unique. The detail in the footage is incredible.The characterization is excellent and the characters of the film are very well paid.The music of the movie really excites you. The sound effects of the movie have been used quite appropriately. The different graphic style of each world is unique in this part and you will be delighted to see the unique graphic style of the film. The visual aspect of the film will surround you. One of the most eye-catching movies I have seen in my life.The best movie that you can watch with your family and friends on the weekend and immerse yourself in pleasure and emotions. Even if you have no interest in the world of comics and heroes, this movie will captivate you with its beauty.Do not deprive yourself of seeing this work of art. The creation of such a pure work cannot be repeated for many years.The story is very engaging. You will be involved in the relationships between the characters of the film from the beginning to the end. The excitement of the movie is indescribable and the speed of events is very high.",positive
344,"I won't be surprised if this movie gets nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. It's THAT good, and that's just the story. Never mind the groundbreaking ways the story is told... the way the viewer can feel the emotions... the power of the fight scenes... all as if it were live action. But no, this film bridges the gap between graphic novel, comic book, and live action - brilliantly taking the best of each to tell a story in ways I'm not sure a story has been told.The makers and investors involved with Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse took a massive risk, needing to thread the needle just right to make the graphic novel animation style not appear gimmicky. And wow, did they ever thread that needle. People are going to remember this movie for a long, long time.",positive
345,"In my opinion this movie is a clear downgrade of the original, and the reason is clear. Sequel-itis almost always aims to make the sequel bigger and better than the first film. Usually this makes the film worse than it's predecessor, but sometimes it make it even greater.For me, this movie goes too far visually and thematically and both the plot and visuals are messy at times. Don't get me wrong: this movie is beautiful. But at times, especially during action scenes the movie is hard to follow. I prefer the first films cinematography dramatically. This soundtrack is good as well, but again a downgrade.72/100.",positive
346,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was a masterpiece and one of the best movies I've ever watched. This is even better than the first movie. The animation is spectacular, the characters are outstanding, the voice acting is superb, the action scenes are so fun to watch, the writing is amazing, and the soundtrack is really good.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is not only the best movie of 2023, but the best movie I've ever watched. It's also the best animated movie I've ever watched. No other 2023 movie will surpass it. Definitely recommended. This sequel was totally worth the five-year wait.",positive
347,"This Movie was fanaminal, The characters were funny, The Spot was an amazing villain and perfect for the villain of the movie also a cameo from my favorite animated. Spider-Man The Spectacular Spider-Man who has a talking cameo voiced by Josh Keaton!! I was clapping for him when he came on LOL! The story was perfect and Peter B Parker and His Daughter were the best parts of the movie in my opion also Spider-Man 2099 was so cool and that Lego Scene was fanaminal. I know people are gonna mad at me for this but I hate Spider-Punk he is the worst and I also wish he was a white guy. Thanks for reading and by the way this is Mr Beast and I love this Movie!",positive
348,I was blown away at this movie. I already had high expectations because of into the spider verse being incredible but man the 2nd and 3rd act of this movie was mindblowing. All these intresring and crazy characters getting introduced like miguel and all these twists happen. And that ending scene built so much tension it was crazy still mad that it's a cliffhanger. Amazing visuals and animation and the time it must of took to animate the scene of all the spider man's is crazy. 10/10 movie recommend to anyone even if they don't like spider man or animation. This is a must watch movie and one of the best cinema experiences.,positive
349,"Already watched the 1st movie 3 times and I knew they wouldn't mess up. It was just not possible for them to mess up. After watching this movie, I gladly say this was the best movie I've seen period. There's no moments leaving you to solve some algebric expressions. Everything is just so well put together and easy to understand. The animation was top tier as usual. So much detail was put into this movie that every screenshot is a wallpaper. Although the ending was a cliffhanger, in my opinion I was very satisfied with it and can't wait to see what'll happen next. 10/10 movie not even debatable.",positive
350,"This movie is a masterclass in visuals with phenomenal story telling, great character foucus & emotional beats it's quipy but in my opinion those quips don't get in the way of any serious emotional moments or feel out of place. It's well paced, in fact it feels like it's moving at ""break neck"" speeds especially during the action sequences, it definitely in my opinion doesn't feel like the 2hr + run-time that it has. The voice acting as well is phenomenal hailee Steinfeld has always been amazing at that just look at Arcane, Oscar Isaac is great as well, as it to be expected. In my opinion this is one of the greatest sequels of all time and if they stick the landing with the 3rd installment then they'll have one the greatest trilogies in movie history on there hands. Understandably some critics are a bit dissatisfied with the cliff hanger ending, but considering the next movie is just a year away it's fine with me. Depending on how the next movie turns out I may comeback and change my score to a 10.",positive
351,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! This film is an actual masterpiece of cinematic storytelling. This film is incredibly animated and you can tell that the people who worked on this film really put 100% effort into this and spent a lot of time making it. It does not feel rushed at all and all the characters in this film go through incredible story arcs and grow as people. This film expands on and improves on just about EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of Into the Spider-Verse and is just a better film, the one criticism that people have is that it doesn't get a proper ending, and why the hell did you expect it to? It's a part one, it has been since the day it was announced. I personally like the way it ended with the Gwen finally letting go of this Spider-Society and forming a team to try and find Miles and stop Miguel O'Hara. This is as much of Gwen's story as it is Miles and she is incredible in this film, but just like the first one, MILES STEALS THE SHOW! Miles is incredible in this film as he comes into his own and proves himself to be one of the best and most skilled Spider-Man of all time and far more than just ""an anomaly"" and proves himself worthy of the title by outsmarting hundreds of Spider-Men, AND MIGUEL O'HARA! This film is absolutely amazing.",positive
352,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolutely amazing movie.

353,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This is only Part 1 of a two-part sequel. Sweet! Fans are thrilled, rewarding the movie with $221 million at the worldwide opening. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson, a truly magical team.Writing credits go to Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and David Callaham. The story is about Miles Morales who catapults across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People charged with protecting its very existence. When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.THINGS I LIKED:
The animation is colorful, energetic, and impressively expressive. It combines classic comic book design with modern-day CGI for a thrilling effect. Each frame looks like it came straight out of a moving comic book. Fans are completely nerding out!The cast of voice talents includes Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Jason Schwartzman, Brian Tyree Henry, J. K. Simmons, Luna Lauren Velez, Greta Lee, Rachel Dratch, Jorma Taccone, Karan Soni, and Shea Whigham.The script is extremely inventive, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time.We get some creative villains that come from various multiverses.Lots and lots of action!The movie takes place across 6 dimensions with 240 characters in it and over 1,000 animators working on it! It's the largest crew of any animated movie ever made!So many Easter eggs. They include references to six decades of movies, video games, cartoons, and comics. Wow.This is one of those movies that you HAVE to watch more than once in order to catch everything. Scratch that...two or three times! The frames fly so fast and furiously that you simply can't see it all.I've never read comic books, but I hear the movie stays true to the source material.I got a kick out of the Spot villain, the Lego spider verse, and the Indian Spider-Man. Haha
I've always loved animated movies that include live-action characters.The cliffhanger will leave you counting the days until the next installment.Surprising twists caught me off guard. Sweet.There is plenty of humor, both spoken and visual.I've just seen a Nicolas Cage cameo in two different movies in two days! His appearance always gets a laugh from the audience. The other is in the new movie that just came out: The Flash. It's another fun adventure into the metaverse!You can definitely enjoy this movie without having seen the first Spider-verse one; however, you'll understand and appreciate it even more if you have.If you love Hailee Steinfeld's character of Gwen Stacey, you'll be excited to know that a female-focused spin-off is currently in development.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers and fans will be annoyed that the movie doesn't actually end at the end and they'll have to wait an entire year to see the rest of the story. Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-verse is scheduled to be released on March 29, 2024.Some of the action scenes are chaotic and happen so fast that you don't have time to really savor the moment.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is not just some random kids' movie. It's very mature and filled with humor and insights that adults can enjoy.Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles.!",positive
354,"I don't know how to begin describing this movie and the spider-verse trilogy in general. It's a breath of fresh air and it personally made me fall in love with animated movies again. The art style is perfect. The dialogue, script, and actor performances beautifully compliment each other. It is without question one of the best movies of the year. But I have to admit that even such a great movie has fallen for the Hollywood sequel curse. To understand that, we need to look back at the first movie of the trilogy. Into the spider-verse was an amazing movie that felt like a genuine passion project that was made with love. But more importantly, it felt like a standalone movie with a cohesive story. Meaning that if the series ended with just that one movie then I wouldn't be mad. This is where Across the spider-verse falls short. I was surprised when I saw that I had watched almost 2 hours of it without reaching any form of climax. I was confused and I thought there was a problem with my digital copy of the movie. Until I reached the ending where I found out that they intentionally used up almost 75% of the movie's runtime just to build up for the last installment in the trilogy. Even though I was really enjoying the movie from start to finish, the ending left me greatly disappointed and utterly dissatisfied. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One did the exact same thing. A whole movie that means nothing on it's own. Which honestly makes me wanna tell you to not watch this movie until the 3rd part comes out. Otherwise you'll be in for an enjoyable but unsatisfying experience.",positive
355,"I finally got around to watching Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse and I'm so happy that I did, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and know I'll be rewatching it soon. I managed to avoid spoilers for this movie and I'm so happy that I did because I went in not knowing anything besides information from the previous movie. This movie starts by giving us Gwen's backstory which I found heartbreaking, the visuals were strong and the music added to the story and then from there we go back to Miles which the story focuses on. I like the subtle detail of the music changing depending on what dimension they're in and who's involved, I also loved the themes being incorporated into the music too.The character introductions were amazing, funny, and unique to every spider person, I love how they animated everyone differently depending on what dimension they came from to show that difference. Also, their designs! I'm in love with them all, they're so detailed, it almost leaves me speechless. As well as I love how everyone interacts with their environment, they see things from unique perspectives and move in such bouncy ways that it looks natural for anybody to do, but I know that if I tried to move the way they did I'd pull something. But this detail especially shows during action scenes, they make the world seem bigger, and they make the fights engaging and fun to watch.Storywise, I loved the comedy and found myself laughing at the jokes and how the characters interacted. I loved the natural mix of different languages and when the characters were speaking in their native language I felt like that was just between characters and not really for the audience to understand what's being said but how it's being said. Also, the visual details of character growth since the previous movie, Miles grew, Gwen grew and her hair got longer, it makes it seem like just because we don't see the characters their lives are still ongoing. I also loved the connection between Miles and the villain, it calls back to the previous movie.Overall, this movie is not only visually appealing but emotional too. The music is powerful, and the story is engaging and at times funny too. I did not see that plot twist ending though, but it makes me excited to see another movie!",positive
356,"How is this reviewed better than the first one? Lots of repeating storyline, a little confusing, cinematically worse certainly. I don't feel like we had as clear of a plot when you're thinking of the why if it all either. I did enjoy plenty of the references, the Mumbattan scenes were by far the best. But I'm disappointed in how Miguel is portrayed, I'm not a huge fan or the way Miles gets punked around on earth 42 and I really think a lot of the Spider HQ was super over the top and a little lame. I cannot also think that a 2 part movie with a drawn out storyline is better than the first one. Looking forward for the sequel to the sequel but it will be years probably and then I'll have lost my hype. Meh.",neutral
357,"Honest and totally honest. If people are giving 8-9 stars for just graphics and designing & VFX, back up people, there's alot more there should be for a 9 star.It starts good, it gives you hopes, the comedy is good, but then, it gets all sentimental and emotional. I know it's needed, but it just gets so much that it kind of gets sleepy.They carry the story too slow because of this emotional backstories, not actually focusing on the main writing, I don't really think the back stories were really required so much and even more so, not so much in DETAIL.After all things said and done, the movie heads to main plotline, how to get to stop the villain, a squad is formed for that, the main character is stuck and needs to find a way out, it all gets interesting, and then, A CLIFFHANGER. End.Wasted too much time in the unnecessary and making a part 3 out of that seems like a 'loosen your pocket for more in the next one'.People giving 8-9 stars, even 10, seriously! Grow up kiddos. This movie wasn't MARVEL at all. It was Disneyland for kids.",neutral
358,"There is not enough good things I can say about this movie, except, go and watch it, its amazing. I have never seen a sequel so good, I honestly think it was better then the first film. The movie is beautifully constructed. The art work is phenomenal and story is extremely interesting. It has everything in a movie that you could ask for and its great for all audiences. There is no agenda being pushed, or political message trying to be told, instead its just a good old fashion movie with a ton of fun, action and adventure, great family values and innocent love. It has the perfect balance of everything. The art work is stunning. And the story is captivating. I could honestly sit and watch this movie over and over again.",positive
359,"Into the Spider-Verse showed us just a crumb of visual possibilities; Across the Spider-Verse doesn't hold back and brings us the most stunning visuals we've ever seen in animation. The details in the animation is mindblowing, like Miles' new suit that feels vibrant with the colors and texture.This is brave storytelling, this is art, this is the pure meaning with film and this is a breathtaking absolute masterpiece.The runtime is deserved and enjoyable thru out, it dares to set it own terms with giving us the plot and hang with the characters. There are brilliant tie-ins to the established multiverse, the character gallery is even better than Into the Spider-Verse and you can really feel the high stakes. Truly unpredictable and I wasn't prepared at all for the ending.Go watch it on IMAX-screen!",positive
360,"As a fan of Spider-Man, I was invested in watching this movie, especially since I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse back in 2018. After watching Across the Spider-Verse, I can easily say that this movie was phenomenal in every way possible from beginning to end. It's easily my 2nd favorite Spider-Man Movie just behind Spider-Man 2 (2004). I can honestly say that if Beyond the Spider-Verse is just as phenomenal or even better than this movie, then the Spider-Verse Trilogy will forever go down in history as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history. This movie is absolutely a must watch for both Superhero & Animated movie fans.A Perfect 10/10!!!!!",positive
361,"For only the 16th time ever, this movie gets a perfect 10/10 from me. How come? Without a doubt, Across the Spider-Verse has done something that is completely new and original while still be a sequel to a previous film.I can not imagine a single person going to see this movie and not absolutely loving it. First off, the movie is visually stunning. Each frame is a work of art while the film switches from art styles at rapid pace without distracting from the story in any way. The writers were much more bold and complex with the story this time around and it most definitely paid off. I was engaged in the storyline of every single character and could not stop imagining what a film about each person could be like. Finally, the sound was absolutely absurd! I could not believe at some points how fantastic the visuals and sound meshed together to bring the film to life.Across the Spider-Verse benefits heavily from its predecessor. With a lot less explaining needing to go on about character backstories, the whole film was an adventure and I am here for it. Even when things were needed to be explained, like the multiverse, it was done so beautifully and well.

362,"I think as audiences we know how hard it is for sequels to meet our expectations when the first installment of a saga was already an outstanding piece of art, it feels so good when sequels keep those standards...The sequel of the Spider-Verse gets almost everything right, it manages to bring you back to the insanely original multiverse storyline that was introduced to us on the first film, yet it manages to not fall into the trap of being a repetitive storyline with the same elements.I can't even properly comment the animation work, there are no words to describe how amazing it is, the detail that each universe depicted seems to have its own kind of animation is insane and it continues to be without a doubt the only Marvel / DC movie to make a proper homage to comic books, the original super hero format.It keeps the frenetic energy that the first got us used to, something is always happening and it's interesting to keep following, elements of the first story are brought to continue the protagonists journey and it's an organic narrative, doesn't feel like a forced story line for the sake of a sequel, it makes sense.All universes are beautifully animated, the soundtrack gives you ton of energy, everywhere in the movie you see marvelous imagery, a true piece of art.Adding the this the voice acting is also on point, it's an animated movie and it feels that it is leading the way on how animation should be used specially on the super hero / comic book adaptation world.Filled with dramatic and eye tearing moments and of course with themes that are transversal to probably every person either parent or child and that most of us can probably relate, gives soul to an already beautiful film. A pioneer film that continues on top of its game, I can't wait for the third..!",positive
363,"Does Across the Spider-Verse really deserves the 8.9 score it currently holds on Imdb? I don't know, but I enjoyed it immensely from beginning to end, leaving my hopes very high for its next part.Despite its unusual lenght, it never gets boring, keep the same level of fun and excitement from its predecessor, with a rather impressive mixture of many different animation styles and a solid characterization for its large cast.The bar has been set pretty high, and I really hope the sequel does not disappoint. I think it would the be the ultimate resolution of all the loose ends left here which will ultimately decide the staying power of the Spiderverse series.8.5/10.",neutral
364,"Debate here is it a movie? Is it a cartoon movie? Spiderman was always fun to watch in the years before this rendition. The mistake was made only one is they should have used a better media than this. When movies watched each has their own what is good and what is bad.... I cant rate this movie any sense because cartoonish concept isn't really what i expected here. They should have made this TV series and never made it into this cartoon movie. Irt doesn't mean it's bad, its means They didn't want to put the man power in the Dev. Of the movie and just used less man time in dev to made movie then pay staff........ If it was live action, it would have cost more and looked much better than this did..",neutral
365,"To be honest it felt like I was watching 2 hours of setup, very good setup don't get me wrong. But, if the movie after this isn't amazing I feel all this won't be worth it. It was great to see characters be and exist and have their petty drama becuase we get to see more of them in a non-adventure setting. And they should have made Miguel have bigger chompers tbh. He seemed a little flat and I hope he will developed more later,But I don't like how Miles went as a character he turned into the actual teenager he is,The colors are fantastic and the colors for each character is striking and so unique it was a great watch but was a little slow and hopefully the pay-off is big enough to warrant the 2 hours of set up.",positive
366,"Spider-Man: Across the spider verse(2023)This movie is a continuation from Into the spider verse and it expands the movie as a whole and it gets progressively better by the dimension they enter in and it got a lot of characters and i mean A LOT A LOT !The art style is what made this movie expands like this and it made what ever the characters are you've got spider punk and spider man india ( was hoping for more screen time ) and spider rex spider cat blah blah blah and moreThe movie is pretty good but the end left me really confused , the last 20 minutes of the film i was confused as heck i couldn't even know what was happening and just overall confused and SHOCKED by what was almost at near the endOverall a build up movie for beyond the spider verse but still cool ! This movie is kinda nuts tbh love it and its very enjoyable would recommend to everyoneoh yeah and btw the main villain of this movie is kinda scary tbh and thats how good the movie isI would recommend to watch the first one then ATSV :-)",positive
367,"They could have told the story in 1 and a half hours - cut 40 minutes off. Didn't have the same ""feel good"" spirit of the first. CGI fight scenes were just flashes of light - going on way too long. The villain Spot should have been more thoroughly explained - Spidey caused him?? The Central Spider Control sequence should have been more developed - more info on ""Hobie"" and the avatar would have been nice. Uh - I guess what I'm asking for is a little more emphasis on character development. If that had been done and had been the reason for the length - the over 2 hours would not have been a concern. Spider against Spider - ech! So - they left an obvious ""to be continued"". And in a couple of years when the sequel is available for streaming - I guess I'll watch to see what happens and see if I don't start to doze off and the have to rewind to make sure i didn't miss something.",positive
368,"Wish the director included a playback speed button like they have on youtube ha. This movie is super fast, scenes fly by in an instant so good luck trying to comprehend what is happening. I felt like i involuntary took a load of speed and jumped into the spider-verse wity my eyelids sellotaped wide open. The plot is all over the place and the motives of the antagonists are unclear (The first one was a bit of an enigma, what ever happened to him?). The story was not compelling enough and with no end in sight the cliffhanger leaves you feeling very frustrated. Although the art is exceptional I wont find myself watching this again anytime soon.",positive
369,"'Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023)' is overwhelmingly fantastic. I'm still buzzing just thinking about it. If the first flick put the bar for stylised animation in the stratosphere, this just catapulted it into another dimension. It's hard to put into words just how viscerally vibrant and visually stunning it is. Its set-pieces simply hit different. The animation, the energy, the aesthetics, the choreography, the music, the sound design, everything just comes together in its unique brand of finely-tuned controlled chaos that keeps each and every exhilarating moment crystal clear even when there's a million different things happening all at once. It's phenomenal. It isn't afraid to pump the breaks every once in a while, too. It slows down considerably to develop its characters and explore their relationships with one another. It's actually quite an emotional experience at times. It has an unconventional structure and, as a result, it takes some pretty big swings with its story. There are some sequences that could have been tightened up and I really wish the picture had retained its original Part One title just to temper people's expectations, but the fact that this film's biggest flaw is simply that it ends is almost unbelievable. I can't say it's better than 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' because it's essentially only half of what it's eventually going to be, but it's a miracle that it's at least as good as that masterpiece (and even outperforms it in terms of sheer spectacle). If they manage to stick the landing with the upcoming sequel (which I have no doubt they will), this is going to be one of the best five-hour movies ever made.",positive

Many people may think that it is a children's movie, but it is a movie that can be watched by all ages.Really, this series is going crazy, I'm waiting and watching each movie with more excitement than the previous one.

375,"The most overrated film I've seen, if I could give a 6.5 I would. Everyone keeps saying you're missing out on the best movie ever. Trust me you're not missing out on Jack it's an okay film not even about Miles Morales, the first half of the movie is all about poor Gwen and her backstory which is extremely overdone and boring and then the last 45mins is back to Miles and his story. Terrible cliffhanger as well everyone knew that it would be doppelg√§nger Miles. Terrible sequel to a fantastic first instalment. Cool villain tho Spot saved the whole movie. Also Punk Spiderman Hobbie was sick might be the only reason why i enjoyed it.",neutral
376,"I enjoyed the first part, Into The Spider-verse, but in my opinion, this one, the first movie's sequel, was much better, very entertaining, and I left the movie theater feeling joyful for watching what happens next.The best part, in my opinion, was the visuals. I love how they make the visuals look like they are from a comic book, I also agree that this was a labor of love by the team behind the movie making. The action sequences are amazing and jaw dropping as well.I think this will be a great film that all fans of Spider Man, young and old will enjoy, its a every interesting, exciting film.Shameik Moore did an amazing job, and so did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was the most interesting part of the film.This film is an amazing film! I think it was worth going to watch at the theaters, and purchase the film once it came out. Go Spider-Man!",positive
377,I was really excited for this movie because of all the hype and everyone saying it was the best film ever but after coming out of it I just think its just okay. I think animation and vfx whise it's stunning but story whise not so much. About an hour of the film was just about miles just being spiderman then finally when Gwen shows up it starts to move at a better pace. We see all the other spider people which was cool. The cameos where sick especially Andrew and Spectacular spiderman. I think the Spot is a really bad stupid villian which should have been in the film more and should've been more serious. The best part of the film for me is Spiderman 2099. Miguel is sick and he's good in the film. So overall I think it's a 6/10.,positive
378,"I love comic book adaptations. I have watched Cartoons/Animated Series since I was a child, so for over 40 years.This is the first movie I have walked out of and asked for a refund in about 20 to 25 years. The animation that everyone seems to be hyping was spasmodic. It actually hurt to watch. I do not have epilepsy or any other neurological disorder, but I felt ill and had to leave or risk making a mess that no one working in the theater gets paid enough to clean.The plot, in as much as I saw, was pure drivel. Just juvenile angstness. Maybe teens will like it for that reason.I obviously won't be watching the next movie.",positive
379,"It was visually amazing! Every 10 years, we may have the chance to watch such a spectacular work.The music in all the moments of the movie seemed to convey the emotions of the characters to us.Despite all its complexities, the story speaks to us in the clearest and most direct way possible.This episode was even more mature, attractive, and eye-catching than the previous episode.It can be said that almost all the details were observed in this animation. Great visual appeal, interesting and smooth and well-thought-out story, boundless excitement, perfect characterization, music intertwined with what we see, what else do we expect from a movie?!When you watch this movie, every hour passes like a second, and after it's over, you regret why this long-lasting movie doesn't last for hours and days!",positive
380,"Never would have thought this movie would be 'MILES' better than its prequel, the countless amount of easter eggs for the Spider-fans, along with an engaging story that had its fun parts of action and meaningful interactions between well-thought out characters without losing the pace or intensity of the story. Across the Spider-Verse is a testament of immaculate craftsmanship from the passion and hard work done by the animators and writers of the prequel. The pacing is splendidly well-done, even the times where nothing major happens in the story is filled to the brim with fun interactions that breathe character to the people we all love in this story. I'll be waiting for Beyond the Spider-Verse next year. Go above and beyond!",positive
381,"The movie is a love letter to all fans because the fans met Spider-Man via various sources such as the comics, tv shows, movies, games or even toys. I am happy people behind Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse are super aware of it and respectfully assemble all of us here. People were excited to watch No Way Home but in my opinion this movie makes it way better because multiverse is a solid part of the story what contains something more than a team-up and references.1. The animation is groundbreaking and raises the bar even higher for animated movies because it is beautifully connected with scenes, not just to make a unique universe2. However it is very intense, I think it's way more faster so if you want to enjoy the style you might feel little annoyed especially when English is not your first language3. There is a lot of Spider-Man variants which is amazing. I am not spoiling anything but you'll love it so much. They're superb and the story around it is well built. I would say it breaks down the multiverse in a better way than Loki or No Way Home.4. Many variants but not all are used properly. For example Spider-Woman who is pregnant, her plot is irrelevant nor interesting. Peter B. Parker has something more to tell but I didn't like a fact his personality was turned into an overlong joke at some point.5. Miles Morales is the core of the movie along with Spider-Gwen. Both of them are similar, I see them as a complementary piece which is a big plus. The first act is based on their very personal stories and relationships with their parents what become their motivation to lead us through the movie.6. Miguel Ohara is Spider-Man 2099 who is, let's say, a boss of the Spider-Verse. His backstory is briefly described which doesn't make us bored, same with his motivation. You'll become a fan of him if you aren't yet.7. My favorite part of the movie is the second act because we meet all the variants and the entire story catches the train of multiverse. Everything becomes focused on repercussions of Spot (villain) what is interesting and makes you wonder if you were right about the multiverse watching MCU projects.8. The third act is becoming darker and draw a line between protagonist and villains. The story goes to an emotional place, ready to be continued in Beyond the Spider-Verse.",positive
382,"I was worried that the follow-up to what is my favorite movie would fall short, as is the case so often. But even still, I went in with high expectations and they were ABSOLUTELY met. Dare I say this is even better than the first? Animation was innovative and spectacular, script was whip smart and clever as hell, character development surpassed most live-action films, and there were twists and turns all along the way.What made the first so great was built upon in this movie, but they did it in a smart, thoughtful way. I'm remarkably excited for Beyond the Spider-Verse to be released to see how this story ends!",positive
383,"Where do I even begin? I think if there were one word to describe this entire movie, that would be immersive. The animation broke boundaries and that's fitting for a movie centering around the multiverse. The brief live action cameos gave me Who Framed Roger Rabbit vibes and also reminded me a lot of Ralph Bakshi's animation. The soundtrack and voice acting also met and exceeded expectations. The characters remained multidimensional and displayed even greater depth and personal growth. All of them were intriguing, charming, humorous and badass.Now for my one nitpick. (Small spoilers) this movie has a lot of loose ends to tie up. Cliffhanger aside, if the final movie manages to land on its feet, this could be one of the best trilogies of all time. But if it doesn't, oh man would that be disappointing. This movie is the definition of ""bring it on"". A final battle must be won. This is an unfinished journey. I give all my respect to the production team and cast, amazing work. This film was beyond impressive.",positive
384,"The original Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse animated film is one of my favorite films of all time. The animation, the story, the characters (Miles Morales is my favorite Spider character) the soundtrack, the score - all set a precedent for animated movies moving forward when it released in 2018. 5 years later, and it now makes sense why this movie took so long to come out.Spider-Man Across the Spiderverse has officially set a new bar for animated movies. This movie is not only absolutely visually stunning from start to finish, but has by far one of the best iterations of a Spider-Man story to date. The soundtrack and score are absolutely stellar, and only add to the awe inspiring impression that this movie leaves you with. This movie, in my opinion, is as important for the animated movie genre as the original Toy Story. There are times where it seems the screen would blow open, and the world they have built would absorb you. I have tens of thousands of viewing hours of Animated media under my belt, and I mean this when I say that I have never seen something so visually stunning. The colors, the animation styles, the artwork - all of these things are at such a level of mastery that this movie should be considered a case study for animated movies.If you love animated movies, this movie is a must see. If you are at all a Spider-Man fan, this movie is a MUST see. If you are not a Spider-Man fan, this movie is STILL a must see.10/10 an absolute masterpiece of cinema. If you have the chance to catch this movie, and IMAX, definitely do.",positive
385,"I sometimes think that people only give out 1's or 10's for reviews. Giving this a ten and calling it ""the best movie ever"" or giving it a 1 and describing it as a ""waste of time"" is not a rational review.I give this a 7 out of 10 for a few reasons. Let's start withThe good stuff....The animation is very realistic from the shadowing on windows to the integration of Donald Glover's real face, I realized quickly that we've come a long was since the ""who framed roger rabbit days""The balance of comedy and entertainment is not an easy line to tread these days. This film displays relatable and likable characters to an audience of all ages.The movie is creative and although it's not an original concept, the multiverse jumping is still fresh and interesting.The bad stuff....The story dragged. For an ending with a massive cliff hanger, it feels like the story building could have been reduced by a lot.The lack of diversity. Hollywood's ironic definition of diversity is the misrepresentation of white men. Apparently the spider-verse that started with Peter Parker (a white guy) is now represented by a teen white girl, a black pregnant lady on a motorcycle, two Spanish guys, Ziggy Marley and an Indian guy with no white men.",positive
386,"No doubt you would have read the surface level reviews praising the animations and a lot of other aspects of the show such as the writing and storyline but i felt as though it fell a little short, was a bit too long and is being overhyped a bit too much.The entire movie actually begins to overwhelm you visually and literally half-way through. They went a little overkill on every single aspect of the movie from the frenetic action scenes (and cutscenes) to the plethora of other dimensional spider-man/womans'. It felt incredibly layored but at the same time incredibly laboured. It wasn't a very enjoyable watch overall.It felt a bit too much like the Spider-Man animated version of Black Panther : Wakanda Forever. Thematically very heavy, overly emotional, overly heartfelt - over the top in many ways, some good but more often i viewed it in a negative light.The visuals are fantastic. Stylistically brilliant combining the art/draft sketch visuals and blending it together with it's trademark comic book animation.In my opinion it fell very short of Into the Spider-Verse.",positive
387,"Lwe love the movie, and I will not give away too much. The only thing is I think we should of let Miles get the girl. All other versions of Spider man has changed why can't his change a little and let him have a happy end to his story. All other Spider man's have lost well maybe not one the dad Spider man. But that is our opinion. We love all the variations of Spider man, and all the types of animation. We love the story line, and love that they used even the live action versions in the movie too. It was exciting to watch and funny, it captured all eye and took you on a journey. Our family recommended you watch the first one if you haven't yet, then this one. Enjoy.",positive
388,"A super mumbo jumbo verse of an animation, sadly based on Marvel Spider-Man. It is way worse story-wise than 'Into the Spider Verse', has worse animation respectively (view & texture-wise), though its specific animation and the dedication put to it are the movies' best and shiniest forte.Unfortunately, after 2 hours 20 minutes it is to be continued; that added to the huge horde of multi-unlikable Spider-Men!, aside Gwen Stacy (the one and only) and the baby Spider girl, made it a forgettable experience up until the next mega horde of Spider-Men show their faces likely around 2026-2027, potentially titled 'Through the Spider-Verse'.Screenplay/storyline/plots: 5Development: 6.5Realism: 5.5Entertainment: 5.5Voice: 7.5(Filming/photography/cinematography) Animation: 9.3VFX animation: 9.3Music/score/sound: 7.5Depth: 6Logic: 3.5Flow: 5.5Animation/action/adventure: 5.5Ending: 4.",neutral
389,"Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse, a movie that I anticipated with high expectations, ended up being a somewhat disappointing experience for me. Despite its amazing animation style and the wealth of comic book references it offers, the plot itself turned out to be rather bland and boring. This sequel relies heavily on visual aesthetics and homage to Spider-Man's rich comic book history, but sadly lacks the same narrative depth that made its predecessor so successful.Despite these criticisms, I can't deny that Spider-Man Across The Spider-Verse has its merits. The action sequences are breathtaking and there are brilliant moments that remind us why we love Spider-Man in all his forms. In addition, the film is still a feast for comic book fans, with endless winks and references that will delight connoisseurs of the Spider-Man world.",positive
390,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a great follow-up that builds off the themes introduced in 2018's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. From what was such a great origin story that helped Miles plant his feet and feel secure, I was wondering how things would progress from there. Instead of regressing Miles to make the plot move forward, we are introduced to several internal and external conflicts that feel completely natural. Miles' struggle with responsibility is a Spider-Man staple and his grappling with telling his loved ones about an important side of himself and stopping lying is compelling to watch. The audience can see and feel his turmoil with his heavy secret, as well as see things from his parents' perspective, as they watch their child refuse to open up to them. This movie puts a magnifying glass on Miles' relationships, examining them in ways that are realistically brutal. Miles' relationship with the Spider-People he met in the last movie, specifically Gwen, is expanded upon, adding complexity to this new world he's a part of.Characters are the strength of this movie and where it really shines. The movie surprisingly starts with Gwen and goes through her origin story and struggles in a sequence that is depicted with rich colors, creating a thick level of emotion. We're there just long enough to adapt to her world and get more insight into Gwen's character before we switch to Miles' tackling the common Spider-Man theme of responsibility.The meta-narrative of Miles not being recognized as a ""true"" Spider-Man is used to great effect and is shown to be pretty nonsensical. Spider-Man has existed in many different shapes and forms, and Miles is just another example of this. We see him triumph through loss and take on the responsibility of being Spider-Man, even when it's hard. It's a great follow-up to the idea of anyone wearing the mask that was so prominent in ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.""The animation is pristine and is not afraid to get wild, featuring stop-motion animation for the Lego Spider-Man and constantly moving colored papers attached to Hobie Brown's model. Even the start of the movie shows some beautiful watercolor-like texture for Gwen's home dimension. For the most part, everything involving the visual art of this movie was nothing short of perfect. However, some of the scenes with the Spider-Society and character models definitely took me out of the movie. Specifically, the Spectacular Spider-Man looked off, with his 3D model and short stature just looking way too specific and different from everyone else. Some specific designs, like his, felt either improperly done or just phoned in to not give the animators the ridiculous task of making sure that every Spider-Person looks perfect.Even compared to the first movie, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is an ambitious visual accomplishment. The mixing of live-action and animation was done surprisingly well. Donald Glover's Prowler didn't look so separate from the animated characters that it broke my suspension of disbelief. It just worked to add to the concept of the multiverse with vastly different worlds. Seeing his character was somewhat jarring, but not to the point where I felt less immersed. However, the scene with Spot and Mrs. Chen from Sony's Venom was short but the worst piece of fanservice in this movie. Spot being placed in the real world, where all of the background and items are real, made the moment look like a commercial that features a cute animated mascot. It goes too heavy on the live action, for a character that is completely unmemorable in regards to the Spider-Man mythos and even in the ""Venom"" movie alone. Peggy Lu's acting here is completely wooden, feeling like a caricature of what her character is supposed to be. Out of the entire movie, it was the one scene that I thought was too awful.One of the hardest parts to deal with in this movie is how unfinished the ending feels. And that's because the ending isn't an ending at all. It's just a setup for the next movie. I'm not opposed to two-parters or movies that build bridges between each other, but a lack of a definitive ending hurts the film in this case because of how much time is spent building up to that moment. Most of the third act is spent gaining momentum for the next movie, instead of focusing on itself. This is why, in part, some of the big reveals didn't work for me. When Miles tells his mother about how he was rejected by the Spider-Society, which serves as a follow-up to their conversation on the rooftop, and tells her that he's Spider-Man, it falls flat as a prelude to a twist. It was such a raw and genuine moment that's wasted on Earth-42 Rio, who's not his mother. I feel like any future moment of an identity reveal is just crippled by Miles already being so vulnerable here. Creating a shocking moment and leaving the audience wanting to see more should not come at the expense of character development.Most of my problems with ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" are just small things. However, these small things do add up. While my problems with the film prevent me from holding it in the same bracket as its predecessor, I still have a lot of love for it. There's a sense of newfound maturity present here as we get a deeper look into preexisting relationships. It takes the concepts set up in ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and transforms them into something both familiar and new. Miles' strong bond with his family is kept, but it is also used as a source of bigger conflict. Miles' newfound friends drive him and are also a source of conflict due to their betrayal of him. Also taking into consideration the inspired visuals, this sequel feels like a step forward and a continuation of the previously established breakthroughs. Not everything that ""Across the Spider-Verse"" tries out works, but the level of innovation cannot be understated. More than anything, this film is a testament to the creativity of animation.",neutral
391,"This is such a cool movie! It's been a long time since I felt this excited about an animated film. The animation is amazing! The vibe reminds me of animated Teen Titans and even a little bit of how I felt watching Power Puffs as a little girl.It's not just action: it's a fresh story line with interesting and diverse characters, the familiar spiderman family angle, and plenty of random fun things throughout (no spoilers!).I love how Gwen and Miles are portrayed.It is a little long, but it has a unique way of story telling that keeps the mind engaged throughout.I'm already looking forward to the next one.",positive
392,"I have a deep admiration for this film, having watched it five times in theaters. It unequivocally stands as the finest Spider-Man movie ever created, and I would have easily granted it a full five stars had they presented the cliffhanger as a part one. While my assertions might seem bold, I'll substantiate them with supporting points below.This movie not only observes Miles settling into his role as Spider-Man, but also reveals the harsh realities that accompany it. The undeniable truth is that just when you believe the challenges might abate, new and life-altering hurdles emerge. In fact, this movie achieves something superior to its predecessor. It vividly displays Miles' mental fortitude and the unwavering strength of his convictions, derived from lessons imparted in the original film. These lessons resonate with both him and the audience that recalls them.As a teenager myself, Miles emerges as an eminently relatable character. His battle to strike a balance between ordinary life and his extraordinary responsibilities deeply resonates, mirroring the struggles that countless teenagers globally confront. His yearning to confide in his parents about his identity as Spider-Man, coupled with the apprehension of their reaction, mirrors universal conflicts-not necessarily about being a superhero, but rather about grappling with broader issues in our world.His parents' protective instincts are palpable, though he remains oblivious to their intentions. His longing for independence clashes with their urge to safeguard him, a universal theme that's both heartwarming and familiar. This dynamic taps into powerful portrayals of parenting and its inherent struggles.The film's commencement immediately signals that it's no ordinary superhero flick. Instead, it serves as a test of morality, resilience, and character evolution-akin only to ""The Dark Knight."" By placing us in Gwen's shoes, the film allows us to understand her profound sense of loss following Peter's demise. Her experiences parallel those of other Spider-people, yet her perspective is distinctive, shaped by her awareness of a broader purpose.The various iterations of the Spider-Verse in the film are each unique, distinguished by their individual color palettes and sounds. Gwen's world, for instance, reacts to her emotions, a stunning and poignant aspect of the narrative.Furthermore, the film's meticulous attention to detail is noteworthy. It not only ages Miles but seamlessly incorporates myriad elements from the original movie, transforming seemingly insignificant gags into pivotal plot elements. This execution feels effortless-I distinctly recall my eyes widening in the theater as a significant past gag seamlessly intertwined with substantial character development.In essence, this film excels in encapsulating Miles' journey, presenting the gritty realities of a Spider-Person's life, and integrating intricate details into a fluid, impactful narrative. It reinvigorates the superhero genre, resonating profoundly with audiences of all ages.",neutral
393,"I rarely say this about cliffhangers but this one hit a spot, a good one.If you loved the first one, you will surely love this one more because...it is more, it has more, and it definitely will entertain you more. You will surely love the grown up Miles and his loved ones.Everything about this sequel was so on point with what a Spider-verse should be like, not a single chance to make a prediction. Very smart storytelling with edgy action and vibrant imagination.Sure, it's another version of Spider Man exploring the multiverse, but it's what has been set up as the base of all Marvel movies and characters therein.Can't wait for the next one!",positive

395,"It's not often that the sequel is better than the original movie. In this case, Spider-Man: Across the Spider Verse is amazing and better than Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse! That's my opinion anyway!I think the plot for this story is really good: it links really well with the previous movie and it's cool to see all the different types of Spider-Man and lots of styles of animation.My only criticism is I thought at the end it could have ended a bit better rather than just stopping.I really hope you watch this movie and enjoy it as much as I did! I hope my review helps and doesn't spoil the story too much.",positive
396,"Very fast moving scene with complicated animations and bgm. Compared to earlier movies, this is really high level for ordinary people. I was looking for decent fun time instead I felt choked with overloaded bgm and scenes. Too much of type casting with typical parents and friends and an actual spider woman girlfriend in another universe. Story is confusing with too much of jumping scenes back and forth. Probably am not an expert , still it is not for everyday movie fan. Am surprised to see that there is another part for this movie. It seems a trend by every movie director to make a nice single movie into two part long movies for making profits. ACROSS SPIDER VERSE is a cross to bear for an ordinary man.",neutral
397,"Better than the First part. Animation.....oh wow. Every different universe had completely different theme which looked so beautiful, what to say. A Gloomy theme to Gwen's universe had an inner depth and it kind of change colors when her father was around. Similarly the Indian spider man universe had so much chaos and portrayed very well. I was skeptical before the movie release about Indian spider man Pavita Prabhakar, but how cool they made him.Apart from animation, the emotional connectivity of the film also really worked well like other spider man movies. Differentiation of Miles from the first part was evident and it was reflected in the movie well. Miguel as half antagonist had an aura around himself, despite being a spider man he felt scary. Spots' intention were also clearly highlighted and this made the villain more connectable.",positive
398,"There are a lot of good things about this film. The animation and art style are just as amazing as the first iteration. The attention to detail is superb. The music choices were great! I was a big fan of the James Blake track and thought that the Bobby Bland track was a perfect fit as well! My issue with this film was the plot. This film has essentially 3 plot lines, and I think it should have just focused on 1. All 3 of these plot lines would have been great on their own and could have been used for their own film. I could have watched an entire film about how Miles and Gwen are both struggling to balance being super heroes while maintaining a relationship with their families. I could have also watched an entire film about Spot starting off as a joke and ending up as a formidable force with themes of revenge and retribution. I also would have been happy with just a story about the conflict between Miles and Miguel. Unfortunately, I think that the choice to combine all 3 of these plot lines really weakened each individual plot and ultimately led to some pacing issues.",positive
399,"This movie is almost impossible to watch, unfortunately I had the kids with me, otherwise I would of left 15 minutes into this snore fest.The story drags on & on & on...The animation is ridiculously annoying, If you have any sensitivity to flashing lights, stay far, far away!Way to many political jabs and references thru out that the younger crowd will not get any way so why include them other to make your unwanted point.While the theatre was maybe 1/5 full it was dead silence ( except for a couple of snoring individuals) , not a peep of excitement out of even 1 person in the crowd. The most exciting thing that happened was when the movie was over and listening to the comments of my fellow disappointed movie goers.",negative

They did a very good job in setting up the ending scenes by a beautifull emotional experience I had since years . The relationship between miles and his parents is so relative to today's parents relations with teens I liked how ALl the fathers admit the difficulty of fatherness even though they still taking with it

Spider-man Across the Spider-verse is another great milestone to the animation movies , visuals were incredibly cool and gorgeous with variety animation styles . This time sequel easily surpasses it's predecessor , narration was great , comparing to it's precursor this movie take some time to build story , establishing characters and some breathe moment rather than just jumping into one action sequence to another , this actually gives us the depth of the characters and stories . Once again many characters and many Spidermans comes across this movie , each had good scope and characterisation . Voice actors did a good job in dubbing . Action sequence were literally roller coaster ride with some goosebumps moments . Background scores were mind blowing .

404,I absolutely enjoyed each minute of this film. As a huge fan of Spider-Man. It incorporates everything you've come to know and love from the actual comics to all the sequels before this oneMiles Morales' story is far from over and it keeps you on your toes. Been a long time since a 2 hour long movie ends with such a great cliffhanger. The escalation of the Nemesis is also quite interesting. Not your regular kind of motive.You simply cannot get enough of the situation until the credits start rolling. The way in which Marvel is playing on the multiverse theory is impeccable and incredibly genius.,positive
405,"A quick review on this.Not at good as the first, but had some cool characters showing up like the British bloke, and megalomaniac Miguel.My eight year old niece was so taken by this installment, however, that I was so glad it showed up on my view list on Netflix queue slightly after our conversation this weekend. I still listen to the soundtrack from the first movie. It's all over my run mix. Guess I was hoping for a similar find of music this time round. Seems as though they tried sticking with the same folks {I suppose there is some Uber cinephile who can address that for sure}.Point is, the movie is good, but I think the first was great. Good is still a feat, since many sequels flat out fail. Good on 'em.Gonna go listen to the whole soundtrack a few more times.Solid all around.",positive
406,"Bigger, better & breathtaking in ways most sequels never manage to, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an ambitious & audacious follow-up that takes what was refreshing & original about its predecessor and builds upon it in ways that catapults its world to better heights and delivers the expected greatness without sacrificing any of the emotional beats that ground its story & characters.Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson in their feature directorial debuts, the film utilises different animations for the different dimensions our characters traverse through while keeping the narrative arresting & accessible from start to finish. And all the time it takes to setup its premise during the first half is the reason why it's able to provide an onslaught of awesomeness in the next half.Everything is an upgrade here, be it the story, characters, animation, visuals, music, wit, gags & underlying themes. And the energy, vibrance, passion, heart & sincerity poured into every frame is evident throughout. Characters, both new & reprising, are treated with care, handled with flair and embedded with personalities. And the twists & revelations surface in ways that only amplify its edge-of-the-seat thrills & our investment in it.The only nitpick for me would be its lack of a proper resolution as it ends on a cliffhanger and is one-half of a full story instead of featuring a self-contained narrative. Nevertheless, it's a minor complaint when taking into account the so many things that it gets right, for there are moments in this picture that had made me wondering if I'm watching the new greatest comic-book film of all time coz it's the perfect story of what it means to be a hero.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a bonafide masterpiece that outshines the first film in almost every aspect and is one of the greatest examples of its genre(s). A marvel of first-rate storytelling and a feat of groundbreaking animation that strikes a perfect balance between its visual & thematic elements, this latest offering in the Spider-Verse series is accomplished on all fronts and will leave its viewers absolutely dazzled yet hungry for more.",positive
407,"Before watching it everyone should know this is only part 1 of the story and this movie ends at a very unexpected moment.Typically with good written 2 part stories, each part has a beginning, middle, and end; with an overarching story connecting the two parts.This just had a lengthy drawn out beginning, a muddled middle and that's it.The producers seemed to want to milk Spider-man fans of their money over multiple movies for no other reason than greed.For 3/4 of this movie, I kept wondering why the plot points were taking so long to get to and why they were seemingly eating up screen time for minor plot points that could be cover in 1/4 of the time.This just seemed to unnecessarily drag on for ever.The ""aha"" came when it ended. They are unnecessarily stretching the story over multiple movies just to cash in on the popularity of the previous film.If you can't tell a complete story within two hours, you're either bad at storytelling or you're taking advantage of your audience's fandom by stretching a 2 hr story across multiple movies.The only exception to this are epics where by the amount of content itself necessary additional time to tell the story. But based upon what I saw in this movie, the overarching storyline would barely require an hour and a half, let alone two two hour movies.",neutral
408,"Title: A Spectacular Spin on Spider-Man: An Animated MarvelReview:As a lifelong Spider-Man fan, I went into the theater with high expectations for the animated Spider-Man movie, and boy, was I not disappointed! ""A Spectacular Spin on Spider-Man"" exceeded all my expectations, delivering a fresh and visually stunning take on the iconic superhero that will leave both die-hard fans and newcomers alike swinging with excitement.The animation in this film is nothing short of revolutionary. The blend of different animation styles and techniques used to portray the various Spider-People from different dimensions is an absolute feast for the eyes. It's like watching a comic book come to life, and every frame is a work of art. The attention to detail in character design, vibrant colors, and the kinetic energy of the action sequences make this film a visual masterpiece.But ""A Spectacular Spin on Spider-Man"" isn't just style over substance. The heart of this movie lies in its storytelling. The plot is a captivating, multiverse-spanning adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The characters are given depth and personality, and their struggles and growth feel genuine. Miles Morales takes center stage as the new Spider-Man, and his journey from a relatable, ordinary teenager to a hero is both touching and inspiring.One of the film's standout features is its fantastic cast of characters from different dimensions. Each Spider-Person brings their unique charm and quirks to the table, making for some hilarious and heartfelt interactions. Peter B. Parker, Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker are all portrayed brilliantly, and their teamwork is a joy to watch. Additionally, the film masterfully explores themes of identity, family, and the responsibility that comes with great power, making it more than just a fun superhero romp.The soundtrack is another highlight. It perfectly complements the action and emotion on screen, with a mix of hip-hop tracks and a heroic score that enhances the overall experience. The music choices are spot-on and add depth to the film's themes.In the end, ""A Spectacular Spin on Spider-Man"" stands as a testament to the creative potential of animated storytelling in the superhero genre. It successfully reinvigorates the Spider-Man mythos and introduces new fans to the character's enduring appeal.

Don't miss this web-slinging adventure; it's an absolute must-see for Spider-Man enthusiasts and animation lovers alike!",positive
409,"First of all the movie was a bit drag, either it should be done around 90 minutes or wrapped the two part story in one movie of 140-160 minutes would be solid package.Other than the above, there was one thing missing and that was the movie with an independent mindset which was there in the first installment, and that was stick to the basic, no marketing gimmicks and no intention to juice out further from this franchise. The script came with a marketing agenda juicing out specific targeted audience to have good cinema earnings around the world, and for that you added unncessary charcters and screenplay time and went off track with the spider man core storyline.On the flip side the twist and turns were awesome, with some nice cinematography .",positive
410,"This movie has no ending. In fact, the first two hours have very little to do with the last thirty minutes and neither stories have a conclusion. I did not realize going into the theater, but this movie only acts as a mediocre stepping stone to a third movie. Across the Spiderverse reminds me of the ""Part One, Part Two) movies that came out in the 2010s. The first have is all set up and extremely boring and the second half is an overly drawn out conclusion and epilogue. Nothing introduced in this story is resolved, but beyond that the content isn't even good to begin with. 80% of this movie is a generic young adult coming-of-age story. If you want to see a teenager struggling with his future, parents, grades, and girls then I'd recommend watching any one of the countless movies that do it better. I'm sure high schooler will relate to and love this movie. Everyone else will have a tough time connecting to the story because it is so two-dimensional and generic. Overall, a very boring film that I do not plan on rewatching.",positive
411,"Miles Morales's story to the next part which traverses through the multiverse. The huge faults create a gigantic messed up cracks and fissures in the symmetrical flow of the timeline. The absolutely astonishing visual style of animation owns this film and teleports it to the place where no other film has reached. This film is bonkers in catering countless creative choices in its every fascinating frame, each looks like a spectacle at best. The graphics and artwork creatively screams and mellows us with its perfect comic style representation. The mega chase sequence with the spider society is an amusing ride. The action sequences are rushing pulses which standout and validify the reason why we shall blow our minds in front of the big screen. The creation team and art team of this film outperforms the first installment and establishes a benchmark for the future of animation. The humour and emotions find a way in this splendid world. The storytelling and narration is well webbed in the long pacing. Miles Morales's appealing storyline is intertwined with multiple other plots across the spider-verse. Gwen's character is a shining lamplight. All the other spideys from different worlds make a place to form the intriguing exploration of the multiverse. The spot is really an unique character choice to add on in the multiverse trajectory. Miles Morales's bond with his parents is an inspiration upon which the story finds a heart and soul. In here also, there is this fate of spiderman, that he or she has to make a sacrifice to withhold the power that flows in him. As every time, the stirring and insightful words from the mentors of spiderman thrives that matters in every storyline to serve the purpose that every superhero needs. The film often softens from its epic tone like a subtle colour to penetrate the bulky ambition and poignant emotions it carries. Probably the finest Spidey film to date. It ends with a cliffhanger, promising a beyond trek. Indeed, this film is a fabulous work of art that reminds us that there is no frontier to creation. It has just pulled us into its world of millions of our own-selves...",positive

I really attempted hyper-focusing on every frame I could and felt like I only captured about 30% of the actual movie.The cinematography and animation left me awestruck and yearning for the third movie (and the second season of Arcane, please). I'm no expert in these things, but it was really creative and a pleasure to watch.Gwen's storyline was a great addition, especially the opening scene. Miles's coming of age and learning the cost of being Spiderman storyline, etc, was done well. The new characters were great and their designs were equally amazing.10/10 movie experience. Somehow improved on the first one, aging well with its audience.",positive

414,"Spider Man: Across the spider-verse was an amazing film in terms of how it was produced as well as the cinematics. One thing I really notice with the new animated spider man films is the fact that their soundtracks and music really suit the atmosphere of the movie, but my main reason for such a high rating is the visuals backing up an intriguing and captivating story that just can't disappoint.I feel like the directors of this movie have done a great job and have delivered another great movie. Those people who are interested in watching the film should definitely watch the first one to provide more context and a better understanding of this movie, but I would genuinely recommend this film to anyone.",positive
415,"I believe the movie creatively manipulates the traditional methods of writing a script for a super hero movie and presents characters in a compelling way.I've broken down various elements that made this movie a perfect 9/10 for meI believe the movie creatively manipulates the traditional methods of writing a script for a super hero movie.-The villain in disguise.How the writers handled spot was simply perfect, at first spot is presented like this harmless dork trying to be a bad guy and we actually consume this perception of spot presented to us, alongside miles the audience also looks down on spot. They summed up his origin during this comedic and soft back and forth going on between him and miles to make him appear like an absolute joke (which also helped in saving time) only to have him get hurt by being looked down on making him snap and transforming him into a multiversal abomination. This is brilliant writing. They simply made us underestimate spot to a point where even we were amazed by the actual evil he turned out to become.The actual villlain.As amazing as spot was, was he the main villain of the movie? He was only disguised as the main villain for the first half as we move on towards the 2nd half of the movie we see Miguel O'Hara gradually becoming the actual villain as Miles refuses to agree with Miguel while every other spiderman did. This resulted in Miguel (being a control freak of a leader) losing his mind completely.The ""hero meets the villain"" scene written to perfectionThe contrast between Miles and Miguel is amazingly written. At first they both argue about their respective visions of morality and Miles not respecting Miguel's argument makes him slowly expose his villainous side to the audience. Miguel being the one to reveal the truth to Miles made perfect sense. Miguel is someone who's everything spiderman is not supposed to be yet he is a spiderman and miles on the other hand was simply never supposed to be spiderman yet more of a spiderman than Miguel.The secondary ""main character""Gwen's character was written so fantastically that at some points she felt like the main character while also not taking any credibility from the movie's actual main character, the movie began with her being broken and controlled and ended with her sorting her issues out and refusing to be controlled any further.-The Main CharacterThe plot of this movie revolves around Miles basically realising how him becoming spiderman was never part of the plan but only a mistake. Miles coming across the soul crushing realization of insignificance and betrayal at the same time while also being exposed to his undeniable fate still trying his best to change it and refusing to accept and play along like everybody else did is incredible character development. This movie establishes Miles as the most spiderman-ish spiderman out there, a spiderman who simply wasn't meant to be, an outcast whose very being is a mistake, these concepts beautifully contribute to the core idea of making the spiderman as human and broken down as possible.The animationThe animation of this movie needs no introduction but the fact that they managed to merge different art styles of different universes into the basic art style of the movie is amazing plus how they used visuals to tell story especially in Gwen's universe was simply divine.Now yes there are some negatives about the plot but again everything else being so perfect about this movie simply overshadows any minor negatives.",positive
416,"I saw the first day in theatre, and I though is a bit large, but I love it.The film is aroud 2h 30min, and you are seeing the film every moments with a lot of spiderman characters.But not only spiderman is greats, the villain in the begining is a joke, but after... WOW! And after, I saw the relationship about Miles Morales with his family... so deep and confusing, like a teenager... but in this case is special.So, the film is great with cinematic, with effects and close up a movement comic. I love all... the bad jokes and the charisma about everybody.I recommend, and I want to see the second part.Sorry, english is not my first language.",positive
417,"I would call this movie ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse PART 1"".When you watch a movie, you expect 95% of them to have an end, and for the rest of the 5%, you expect them to say ""part 1"" in the title.This movie doesn't have an end. How can you rate a movie without its end? It's not a bad movie, or a great movie, it's an incomplete movie. I found that the movie before this one was very great. This one has some pros / cons. I liked the graphics most of the time, but it also appears overloaded sometimes, or it looks like too much aesthetic filters have been applied. The main idea of the movie have been a bit overexploited recently (interdimensional travel), I know its the concept of this franchise but it isn't original in the way it's using it. The idea of a city full of spidermen fighting each others, with good and bad spidermen, looks a lot like Rick and Morty Citadel or like the Time Variance Authority in Marvel (which also appears in Loki).Also the movie seems that it wants absolutely everyone to be able to identify with a character, because of that it looses the focus on the main characters and even when the movie is on them, it's a quite boring usual love story between two main characters, the same way the relation between Miles and his parents is conflictual which is also quite usual in these movies.Yet, the main storyline isn't bad but you barely see the main antagonist during the movie and as I said, the movie doesn't have an end which I found was quite frustrating. It's sad because the movie had a great potential. And you could have expected even better for the next one. But no, the next one will just be the continuity of this one, it won't bring another storyline.Overall I rate it 7/10, if the next movie is great they could both be worth an 8, but this movie is incomplete and you can feel it.",positive
418,"After the explosion of the super collider, there is a growing threat to all known worlds. The nature, identity and responsibility of being a Spider-person is examined.This is much bigger than the first, and they even manage to address the rare flaws: this time, despite the many universes and literally hundreds of characters, it never loses focus on Miles Morales(Moore, spot-on), and the creative, memorable action scenes are now each completely, not only mostly, unique. Considering what I just described, you might not believe me when I say that somehow this manages to not be completely overwhelming. That they managed to make the concept simultaneously infinite in possibility and yet not let it get overpowering.You can watch this without having any prior knowledge of the original movie, the comics, or other iterations. It will tell you everything you need to know. Certain things won't have the same emotional impact, and you will have to pay extremely close attention. But they actually managed it. Your average Spider-Man movie says that a person(way too frequently a Peter Parker, about time we got some more diversity) bitten by the right spider will gain superpowers, don a suit and fight crime. This one expands that into Various animals, shows literally dozens of them, in addition to featuring some great representation(ethnic, gender, age, body size). I would have loved to see openly trans individuals, especially considering the intense reactionary backlash against a split second frame in one of the trailers. Here's hoping we'll get there in part three.This is rated PG. There is no swearing or sexuality, and violence is mild. I recommend this to everyone. Regardless of your age, you can find something to love in this. 10/10.",positive
419,"I was really looking forward seeing this movie because of all the 10/10 reviews online. After watching it I find it the most overrated movie of the year. The animations and action is still amazing like in the first movie.Rather than a story split into two movies it feels much more like one movie split in half. It has a very long introduction and shortly after the story begins to get interesting the movie ends. Because of that while the movie is quite long (140 minutes) it feels rather short. Also most of the locations and major events are included in the trailer except for the final 20 minutes which just set up the next movie.All in all I look forward to the second part, hoping that those two parts together will make an amazing story, but I wouldn't recommend watching this movoe on it's own.",positive
420,"I think this and the next spiderverse movie were supposed to be one movie, but Sony saw the succes of the first movie and decided to split it into two parts. First 1,5h feels completely unneccesary, and has a very ""samey"" feeling to the first movie. But worse.Stuff also just kinda happens, and you as a viewer grow numb to it. Multiverse, horse spiderman... Kay... We had all that in the first movie. Do we get some character/story development? Not really.Disappointing movie. Dont believe the hype. Its very pretty and music is great but thats it. I hope the give us a great 3rd movie, but I dont have high Hopes.",positive
421,"A good film, but very overhyped.A loud gasp of disappointment went across the entire 400+ seated cinema. Many people saying it was ""sh!t"" and ""nothing happened"" and ""that was the deadest film""... and I partially agree.While an overall enjoyable film from my perspective, giving it an 8/10, critics have misled audiences AGAIN and set us up for disappointment. Not much...actually happens.We have a very VERY tedius 30ish minute intro and recap to all the characters we already know about, telling us everything we already know about Gwen and Miles, dragging out the runtime. There's no proper villain in the film either, we get a splatter of a few villains throughout, and one will obviously be a bigger villain in the third film, but... yeah...I sort of agree with the people complaining.I did find this more enjoyable than Guardians of the galaxy Vol 3, but its not the masterpiece 10/10 the paid critics give it.",positive
422,"The first Spiderverse film was excellent. Everything worked like a charm. Sometimes we have to choose between amazing special effects and a good story with strong character growth. Every now and again you get a film on the level with Roger Rabbit.Out of this trilogy, they have already given us two magnificent story's. It's like Toy Story where you are in awe of the visual presentation. People like me appreciate when you can see the heart and hard work on the screen. Apparently some studios believe throwing absurd amounts of ðŸ’¸ at the production crew and a good movie will just suddenly appear. When you hire artists with a vision and a passion to inspire the crew to believe in the magic being conjured, then a quality film appears. Life is hard all over and it is a blessing when they give us a product we can treasure. I know the pressure is at ðŸ’¯%, but I pray they get what they need to finish this partial masterpiece.",positive
423,"Miles Morales' second adventure brings him back into contact with Spider-Gwen. Outcast from her own universe where she has been erroneously accused of the death of her Peter, she is now working with a squad of spider-people patrolling the multiverse. Meanwhile, Miles as problems with new villain, The Spot.Plotwise and characterwise, this is fun. It mixes some emotional character stuff with exciting action, and interesting (and sometimes unexpected) plot developments, right up to the end. Oh did I say ""The End""?...There's plenty of fan service here.Yes, but what does it look like? Because the look of the first one was striking, right? I bet this is jnot as good, or just more of the same, right?Wrong. The look of this film, whether a quiet scene in an office, or a hyper-kinetic action scene, is simply dazzling. There are so many animation styles, and touches, and tweaks, and Every. Single. One of them serves a dramatic purpose in the storytelling.Fantasic.",positive
424,"Times moved on since the adventures with your brethren, and life doesn't seem to be just quite as much fun, but a visit from Gwen Stacy, escalates things to quite racy, as you enter other worlds, and start to run; after coming face to face with angry Spot, who's more than capable, of tying knots (especially of himself), but it's revenge that he desires, and now he's pulling all the wires, and the canon has misfired its latest shot; into worlds of masks and costumes that astound, with variations on the theme that just dumbfound, a kaleidoscope of dazzle, of electrifying frazzle, as you leave you just can't wait for the next round.It's just a bit spectacular.",neutral
425,"Does Across the Spider-Verse really deserves the rather impressive 8.9 score it currently holds here on the Internet Movie Database?I don't know, but I can tell I enjoyed a lot this film from beginning to end.Despite its unusual lenght, the movie never gets boring or tedious in any moment, keeping a frenetic pace in every single one of its scenes.Maybe the dialogue was a little bit too ""quippy"" in a couple of moments, but the snappy writing doesn't get in the way of the most dramatic moments, never lessening them in any manner.The animation deserves a particular mention, alternating in a rather different impressive manner several distinct visual styles, taking a full advantage of the medium in a way in which would be almost impossible to depict via live-action.This sequel lives up to the original, and left me with very high expectations towards its continuation.Now that the bar has been set up so high, I really hope the finale of the Spiderverse series doesn't disappoint.So far, the ride has been quite amazing.8.5/10.",positive

When the heroes clash on how to handle a new threat, Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.I'm late, yes I'm and I wish I could make it to the theaters to watch this visually stunning masterpiece on the big screen.ATSV is an extension to what we had in ITSV, the same energy and the problems that Miles Morales had with his identity as the spiderman of his universe, this movie excels in presenting a multiverse concept, it is the best I've seen dealing with this matter.I mean every universe had its own colors, dimensions and animations it is a lot of work to do, it's the most beautifully made animation I've ever seen and most pleasing to watch without a doubt.I'm not going to compare it to the first one, I enjoyed them both and I love them equally I guess, considering that the story haven't come to an end and I'm counting on BTSV to be even better, as better it can goes.I was waiting for ""Calling"" song, it was late but I'm satisfied.",positive
427,"""Across the Spider-Verse"" swings into action as the long-awaited sequel to Sony's ""Into the Spider-verse"" which is regarded by many as a new height for animated movies. The animation continues to raise the bar, challenging the standards set by Pixar, but it doesn't quite match the awe-inspiring visuals of the first movie.One of the film's strengths lies in the character development, particularly for Miles and Gwen. We gain deeper insights into their lives, and Miles' relationship with his parents, especially his mother, is explored with depth and emotion. Unfortunately, many other characters from the previous film receive little to no development, leaving much to be desired. Additionally, the choice of the main villain didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped.While the soundtrack pays homage to its predecessor, it fails to achieve the same exhilarating impact. The music lacks the punch and infectiousness that once made it memorable. On a brighter note, the film delivers tantalizing Easter eggs, scattered sparingly throughout, adding a layer of excitement to the viewing experience.I wont comment on the easter eggs in this movie as I don't wish to spoil anything but they're scattered throughout, and I can only imagine more would become apparent the more you watchOverall, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is an acceptable continuation, definitely worth watching if you enjoyed the first movie. It's understandable why many people appreciate it, but for me, it felt slightly overbloated and even boring at times. Nonetheless, the stunning visuals manage to capture your attention, compensating for the weaker storyline. The movie concludes with a cliffhanger that feels sufficient and creates anticipation for the next installment, making it an exciting prospect.Note: This review is based on the first part of a two-part movie, so some aspects may be further developed and resolved in the next installment.",neutral
428,"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse was one of my favourite comic book films ever, and after all these years the sequel, Across The Spider-Verse has been released and I have finally had a chance to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Miles Morales travel across the multiverse where he meets other Spider-Men that at are charged with protecting it, Miles must understand what it takes to be a true hero.Main Character
Shameik Moore is back as Miles Morales and he is fantastic. He plays the teenage spider-man very well and he is easily likeable which is great to see. There is more to him though, Moore adds real emotion to the story of Morales and the things he goes through is well done. Gwen Stacy voiced by Hailee Steinfeld gets way more to do in this film and I would argue her character is as important as Miles. She gives such an emotional performance and Gwen is a character that we learn a lot about and see how she really fits into this story. The dynamic between both characters is really well delivered and I am glad it worked so well.Supporting Characters
This film has probably the most amount of characters a film ever has, so I certainly won't be going through all of them but I will acknowledge that they are all great.Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez return as Miles parents and they are a large part of this story. Seeing how the dynamic between Miles and his parents goes down is a really crucial element of this film and the two performers did a great job.Oscar Isaac plays Miguel O'Hara and is fantastic. It seems like he is becoming the king of comic book films and shows and he is no different here, O'Hara is the leader of the team of Spider-Men and he is the most serious character in this film. As you learn more about him, you understand why he does what he does and it makes him a really interesting character.Jake Johnson is back as Peter B Parker, though he has a much smaller role. Even though he isn't in the film a huge amount he is used effectively and I felt like he was somebody that added to the overall story of the film and how it affects Miles life.There are some other great characters specifically Jason Schwartzman as The Spot, Issa Rae as Jessica Drew and Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk. They all were fun additions to the cast here.Story
The story is fantastic. As I mentioned above, it focuses equally on Miles Morales & Gwen Stacy and it deals with both stories incredibly well. This film exceeds what the majority of people would expect for an animated film with the amount of depth and emotion that goes ahead with these characters and the situations that they are put in. This is also a great ending, which feels appropriate for the film and effects every character that has been a spotlight of the film.Script
The script is really great. The comedy is well written, this film is funny and not in a childish way. It is clever with its comedy and it picks appropriate times to use it. But the drama is where the film succeeds, you really do care about these characters and how the events in the film change the characters.Style
The first film was amazing to look at and so creative in its design. This film is even better, you can't take your eyes off the screen because of the colours and use of technical devices that no ever film does like it. This films pacing is great too, it clearly has different acts to the film and I was never bored,Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is an Epic film that just like its predecessor is one of the best comic book films ever made. Ignore the fact that it is an animated film, this is an amazing film and especially for Spider-Man films needs to be see.Rating - 10/10.",positive
429,"I love the details in transitions and atmosphere in visual scenes but the rhythm of the whole movie is confusing. Some unnecessary parts and pauses make me feel like...wasting my time, but then good actions and music come, and a few minutes later the boring conversations and ""not good time"" lines come again...I mean you can write a kind of laughing and serious story at the same time, but in this narrative rhythm it won't work when inappropriate interactions and serious plots literally mixing together in one scene, especially after things like settled fate of every Spider-Man happened, the funny and casual behaviors of ALMOST ALL the Spider-Men make motivations and reactions unreal, characters stupid and problems unserious.I dont like the plot setting that makes Miles ""the chosen one"" and some of Spider-Men are special than the others, like they're able to decide things and change the rules, especially when the background is hundreds of spider-men are just out there. What I saw just many great character-designing puppets are blindly following the orders, no self-awareness but unbelievably they're the actual multi-universe version of the same identity, Spider-Men. It's a FAKE multi-universe in a form, there are not enough conversations space for main characters to show their thoughts about the doubts, regrets or struggling, I mean literally no talks between each Spider-Man about the who they are what they capable of or what they lack, kinda disappointed. What's worse, instead of those, too long cliché family discussion and teenager stuff, I know they're also important for the characters to grow up, so I bear with it. But I need to remind you that most of Spider-Men are completely mature adults, in the end, they are not better fighting than miles and even low-brained than this teenager at the age of 15. The longer I watched, more confusions popped up, I just wander what everybody were thinking in lots of scenes, what's the logic of telling miles the truth but then they don't allow him to save his father? What's going on about the fate or pattern of Spider-Man? That it can be broken by miles but everyone else can't or even won't try just believe Miguel's own experience? And how's this fate system working that they think breaking of the pattern is a bad thing so everyone should protect the original timeline, but good stuff can also happen in the new world right? I don't understand the motivation behind all the characters, if they're struggling or confusing too, well, please showing more humanity instead of taking childish actions, and don't all act under 15 please.But overall I like this movie in a way, it has great art forms but some rhythm and plots are kind of uncontrollable weird. Of course, I hate ending that don't give a complete story, it's cheeky.",negative
430,"The Animation is probably off the charts, I cant express this enough with all the spider people and the Gwen's world animation was mesmerizing. BUT, there was no story to it and it took them halfway to arrive at the point when miles arrives at the base hive and Miguel tries to stop him, but that section of the movie is a bit bland.I mean not many things happen in the movie, we see Spot only for sometime in the beginning and when he tries to get a power up which makes holes in the multiverse but we never see its repercussions. It was badly written. Lets hope they do better in the third movie.",negative
431,"What more can be put on the first movie... Well, there's a lot more to build on. Before I start, let me say that I will criticize the movie completely in comparison with the previous movie. If we start with the animation style, which is one of the most prominent details of the first movie: These guys are really breaking new ground in art design with each movie. Even though the animation style used in this movie is the same as in the first movie, in the first movie's scenario, spider men from other universes came to Miles' universe, but this time Miles goes to other universes. Each new universe we see has its own unique drawing style and theme. Even if this is an extremely beautiful detail, I have to say that it is tiring for the eyes. Ahem, if we talk about the script, the script of this movie is a script that will be completed with the sequel, but if we evaluate the part up to this point: While the first movie told a more personal story, in this movie we experience a large-scale, multifaceted story that affects all universes. In short, it's a great movie that really pushed the limits, that made me in crisis as to where I could break points, and since the movie has a very fast pace, you can be sure that I will watch it again or even several times that I may have missed. I kiss the hands of everyone who contributed to this movie and offer my endless respect.",positive
432,"This is how a movie featuring multiverse should be.The first thing that one notices in the movie is how they have amped up their animation game. If you think the the animation in the previous installment was great, wait till you set your eyes on this one. With gorgeous colour palettes, each frame can be a wallpaper on your personal dekstop.No Spoilers here, but if you are a spidey-buff you will have fun picking up on the easter eggs. It is plain to see that the makers have a ton of love for the source material. From references to cameos, you will find everything over here.The soundtrack was also amazing. The collection of songs perfectly captured the tone of the film.The plot of the movie is also something that needs to be appreciated. It makes you root for the character and the third half of the film has a twist that you wouldn't see coming. There was a collectible gasp from the audience in the cinema while I watching, as no one expected. Even though there are jokes, it doesn't distract us from the core narrative, which has been the problem with MCU moviesEven though the movie is 2 hours 20 minutes long, the movie passes away like a breeze, you won't find yourself bored or checking your phone. Which is perfect for a commercial superhero flick.",positive
433,"I will be honest, it will be debatable to pick either this or Into The Spider-Verse that's the better. But either way, it truly blew me away. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is not just among the best Spider-Man movie, but also one of the best animated superhero movie ever created next to The Incredibles. It has exceeded to the expectations people wanted with an exciting story that takes the Spider-Verse to a whole new level, top notch animation, unforgettable characters that has given more personalities to get us to know old and new, intense action, and one of the most shocking cliffhangers since The Empire Strikes Back. To fans of the first film, Spider-Man fans, superhero fans, and even fans of movies, this is the movie I think you are truly gonna enjoy. I really encourage to check it out. After watching this myself, this already got me excited for Beyond The Spider-Verse and hopefully it will give us a perfect ending to all this. I have no idea when that movie is going to come out. But when it does, let's go over this one more time.",neutral
434,"After the wildly creative and emotionally profound ""Into the Spiderverse"" Blew us all Away, the sequel takes us across the spiderverse with keeping the core strengths of the first movie intact, and setting up a spectacular final film that will make this the Greatest Spiderman trilogy. Once again the revolutionizing art style steals the spotlight, with each character getting its own unique color palette and motion art, with visual angles to die for and creating some of the most jaw-dropping action scenes. Once again incredible voice-acting and writing, focusing on the core family bonds and how each spiderman's destiny and story correlate. The Villain ""Spot"" also is given his own unique journey. I dont like Cliffhanger endings in films so that was a negative for me. But what truly matters is that Its a Love Letter to all Spiderman Fans... Go and watch it.",positive
435,"First and foremost, 'Across the Spider-Verse' features animation that is nothing short of spectacular. It pushes the envelope by combining diverse artistic mediums and methods to provide a feast for the eyes. Each frame is a piece of art, with incredible attention to detail, vivid colors, and exciting action scenes. It is simply amazing to see the degree of imagination and skill on show. All the props to the animation team, you guys deserve the inevitable Oscars to coming your way!The plot itself is extremely interesting how it explores new realities and introduces intriguing Spider-Man varieties while diving deeper into the multiverse theory that was previously established in the first film. It was exciting to see established heroes and newcomers, each with special abilities and personalities all come together. The dialogue is witty, and heartfelt, and shows a genuine understanding of what makes Spider-Man such a relatable character.This sequel is a complete accomplishment that serves as a monument to the power of narrative and the virtually endless potential of animation. It's a movie that will speak to viewers of all ages and have a lasting impact. When the ending card appeared, I couldn't believe it had already been over two hours. I'm glad I didn't see spoilers to what the ending card revealed because I could've sat there for another two hours if possible.",positive
436,"Into The Spider-Verse was one of the best superhero movies and animated movies ever made, certainly the strongest Spider-Man movie we've had to date. Until now. Across The Spider-Verse takes all what was great about its predecessor and turns it up to 11, creating what is possibly the best animated movie ever.The animation in this film is next level. The style has evolved since the last film with not only the comic-style but many different styles encompassing different versions of Spider-Man and it all flows together marvellously. Every frame is literally an excellently constructed painting. This aids in the absolutely stunning and immensely creative action sequences, some of the best I've ever seen.The story is once again fantastic. With all this multiversal madness, the writers put Miles' story front and centre. His arc is remarkable and Shameik Moore continues to be the definitive version of the character. Every voice actor does an incredible job, especially Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Every moment of the pair together is wonderful. There is so much going on character-wise and Miles' personal journey has the potential to be the best Spider-Man story arc we've gotten in movie form.Being a big crossover, there are moments of fan service but they're never dwelt upon, the plot and characters remain the focus. If there were any problems to bring up it would be that the main antagonist for the first half of the film disappears for the rest of the film but the villain is still good and is clearly going to be more prevalent in the next film. There is still very strong emotional conflict without him as strong character ideals become the main source of conflict for the rest of the film.Overall, this film should be a 10/10 but because of its place as the first of a two-parter, the second part must stick the landing for it all to be worth it. However, I have immense faith in the filmmakers to pull it off because of the immense quality of this film. It exceeds in all aspects of filmmaking. A must-see for everyone!",positive
437,"Currently placed at 37th position,The fanboys are obviously unanimously giving it a 10/10 rating. As good as this movie its current rank will fall in 6 months time. Coming to the movie,it's entertaining and extremely well written. Its ability to mix so many situations without making a mess of things is its biggest strength. In a year where so many superhero movies disappointed this one was the most fun to watch.. The first one worked precisely for the same reason. Kudos to Marvel/Sony for creating a wholesome entertainer. Don't let the high rank be the barometer before starting the movie. Grab a popcorn and enjoy the movie.",neutral
438,"Just wow.... WOW! This one is an absolute treat for the eyes. STUNNING visuals and design, with beautiful settings and some great fight/chase animations. PERFECT casting and voice acting, they really do add a soul to the characters. A THRILLING story, an emotional rollercoaster that actually ends in a cliffhanger. All combined with some pretty good MUSIC score (although I would have preferred listen to NAV during the movie and not after). I would have never thought that any other Sony/Marvel animated movie could ever top the original Miles Morales' Spiderman, but this one does and by a mile! A MUST WATCH for all generations, can't wait for PART TWO!P. S. The negative reviews are from immature man-childs who cannot make a deal of a movie ending in a cliffhanger. PATHETIC!",positive
439,"The first movie was a masterpiece of animation expertly layered on top of a solid story with compelling, focused characters.For this movie they took the art style and turned up the saturation, contrast, and playback speed by 200%. Then they forgot to write a story and rehashed some already covered ground (my parents don't understand me wahh!) to compensate. Oh and there's no ending. They just cut the movie at a random spot with no effort at resolving anything.The first movie felt like it was written to a mixed audience and took itself seriously. This one felt like it got lost along the way and reverted to a childish teen drama.",positive
440,"Messy movie and boring plot. Overhyped from TikTok generation.""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" movie left me utterly disappointed with its messy and incoherent storyline. From the very beginning, the plot felt disjointed, lacking a clear direction. The pacing was all over the place, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in the characters or their struggles. The attempts at character development were shallow and forced, leaving me feeling disconnected from the protagonist.This film's inability to capture the essence of the source material and provide a coherent, engaging story left me disappointed and regretful of the time spent watching it.People only want to think what others think.",negative
441,"This movie takes the cake ;) by being the best spider-man movie, one of the best animated movies, and the best movie of this year so far! This film is a beautiful masterpiece that is so beautiful and captivating to watch! It tells a contained compelling story with so much heart and feeling!It puts all the wannabe film trying to attempt this animation style to shame because it ups by 100. Its exciting, and so entertaining to watch!Across the spider-verse takes a more serious approach than the prior film but the execution was brilliant and meaningful. It really takes its place as a brilliant comic book movie and a great movie in general! Go see it in theaters to get the full experience!",positive
442,"Another outstanding spectacle filled with depth, character building, emotion, while delivering top notch animation through the entire run time.It uses nostalgia and other funny quirks, for the viewers to take notice of and have a laugh at. Despite that it isn't driven by those aspects, but instead the characters and story. Where the first movie felt like a conclusive origin story about Miles Morales, this instead feels like an expansion of the universe and the beginning of a larger tale.In the end it feels very much like the first part of two, and I can't wait for the second half. That being said, the story still has a but not as conclusive as the first one. Its a bigger and more expansive story, about Miles' journey about what it means to be Spiderman and the responsibility that follows.",positive
443,I was hoping that Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse would at least be half as good as the first.It is superior..!By far the best superhero movie out there. Quite possibly one of the best movies ever created.Animation is superb. Story is faultless. Emotions are real. Miles Morales is an Amazing Spider-Man.An absolute masterpiece and must-watch.If this film isn't up for Best Picture at all the awards next year then the system is broken and we really are in an alternate universe.I do not know half of the characters that are in this film. But I don't need to. The film explains itself as it goes along at the perfect speed.Bravo Sony Pictures! Bravo..!,positive
444,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was super awesome and all of the animations and the effects was so well done and it was beautiful in the most amazing Spider-Man way!The story was so incredible and it was looking like it was telling an incredible superhero story about all the Spider-Man's like directly out of the comics! The acting was phenomenal, the music was so good, and brings so many good jams, and the action and the humor brings you back the first Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.I gotta see these movies again and again, because I would be very excited to see ""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"" if they plan to make it, because Sony has done a marvelous job creating the best animated movies like these beautiful animated Spider-Man movies! Let's go Spider-Man!!!",positive
445,"Probably the most on-point, on-time zeitgeist expression since, well, 2018's Spiderverse film.The high point of wonders here for me comes late in the 2nd act when Miles and his mom talk alone. The mom is the most successful animated character in this film. The film goes on for another 20 minutes of wonderful lyrical visuals. Then I lost track of the plot almost completely. How a multiverse is affected by tangled webs of various Spider-people didn't work as an emotional thru-line for me.ANIMATION JAZZ returns! Animation nerds will know many effects here hark back to animation experiments in the 1950s-1960s of John and Faith Hubley et al. Generally these old pretentious visual effects are put to much better story use here--if several times overdone to the point of sensory overload.DC comics fans will note the Green Lantern Corps clearly inspired the Spider-person Corps here. Be ready for several jolting new spider-personas. I liked their choices.This is another movie which would play longer in theaters if 20 minutes of bloat was cut out; in this case, from end of 2nd act.",positive
446,"Not even the most optimistic of pundits could've ever predicted the glowing reception and success that came the way of 2018's Into the Spider-Verse, slinging to almost $400 million at the worldwide box office, critical praise and a spot entrenched in the upper echelons of the IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Time list, too say that the first iteration of the Spider-Verse animated universe was a roaring and unexpected success would be a huge understatement.Fast forward these close to 5 years on and expectations for teenager Miles Morales/Spider-Man next adventure are sky high but proving that lightning can strike twice, the creative team behind this colourful Spider-Man series overseen by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have once again delivered a frenetic, energetic and most importantly entertaining animated epic that will likely cause much debate as to whether or not this is a case of a rare sequel that may in fact be better than its forefather.Still featuring the oddball humour and near endless parade of in-jokes, homages and side gags that made the first Morales venture such a delight outside of its visual spectacle, Across the Spider-Verse also feels like a much more mature outing this time around, with Morales himself more world weary and battered, coinciding with the film as a whole dealing with some heavy issues and subject matters that at times brings on an unexpectedly sombre tone, with credit going to the creative team here for not being afraid to make their film skew further from the young audience that may not quite understand the nuances on display here all the while allowing older audience members to feast on a film that is far from all style and no substance.Clocking in at close to two and a half hours, Across the Spider-Verse is one of the longest animated films ever widely released into cinemas and there are segments throughout the film where it feels as though we are covering off similar narrative ground on more than one occasion but when Morales adventure into the Multiverse swings into the sky it takes us on an often unforgettable journey, whether it be to a New York done the way of Mumbai or a Spider-filled version of Earth, Across the Spider-Verse has enough imagination and spark to fill countless other animated rides that would be desperate for even a portion of the creative magic on display here.As also was the case the first time around in 2018, this 2023 Spider-Verse features another array of on-song voice performances from its talented cast that works in tandem with the incredible artistry on display throughout, led once more by Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, new additions to the voice cast here such as a scene-stealing Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Jason Schwartzman as The Spot or Daniel Kaluuya as Hobart Brown all bring their A-game to this big budgeted affair, making this an all-round package that has not only lived up to the legacy of the first instalment but arguably surpassed it.Even if there's a feeling of being teased by possibilities once the credits begin to roll here, the hype is going to be overflowing for next years Beyond the Spider-Verse which is setting out to prove that lightning can indeed strike more than twice.Final Say -People may bemoan the amount of Spider-Man themed films we've had slung our way over the past 20 years but if the quality of these outings remains as strong as what we get here with Across the Spider-Verse, they're going to be complaining for a long time yet to come.4 Chai tea's out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",negative
447,"Grew up with $0.25 comic books from DC and Marvel, read hundreds from Spiderman to Elektra Assassin, saw zillions of anime when that landed, saw the zillion Spiderman movies (from Sony and not).SMASV to me is Sony's attempt to do something like a cross between Madoka Magica and Elektra Assassin's visual
Ianguage with even some major character elements adapted.However, it falls short due to its extreme verbosity that steals the anticipation and surprise from what's happening next, turning it into a radio show.Failing at the suspense build up to the main plot points, it turns into one long dialog, often politically correct point shoveled in just to be p.c., about a common teen vs parent argument topic, followed by colorful action animated like a Madoka for the Spiderman multiverse.Great if you love blah, blah, blah, blah, blah that could have been really quickly shown with an unspoken face or body expression, tiresome for those expecting a well-paced and structured comic book movie.What does save it is it's colorful animation style - fresh enough to enjoy while tuning out the long blab.Ultimately, you know when the teens are screaming at the opening title (up to the comic code shot) in excitement, but NOT during the movie itself, oops!This is one Spidey movie that deserves a better rewrite, or at minimum, a much shorter, tighter cut.",positive
448,"Across the Spider-Verse looks incredible, even better than the groundbreaking first installment, but what's truly impressive about it is how willing it is to entrust its storytelling to its animation. There's not a frame of this rich, kaleidoscopically detailed animation that isn't dazzling.Across the Spider-Verse isn't just mind-bending spectacle - although it definitely dazzles in every frame. It's mind-bending spectacle in service of a thrilling story about a teenager facing the horrifying possibility that he can't fix everything. Undoubtedly this has gotta be the best of 2023 and we are gonna get the solution of the cliffhanger that Across the Spider-Verse has stranded us in.My Rating : 10/10.",positive
449,"""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a groundbreaking animated film that takes the Spider-Man franchise to new heights. The film follows the story of Miles Morales, a teenager who gains spider-like abilities and must team up with other Spider-People from different dimensions to save the multiverse.The animation style is a visual feast, with a unique blend of traditional and computer-generated animation that creates a vibrant and dynamic world. The action scenes are breathtaking, with each Spider-Person having their own distinct fighting style that adds to the excitement.But what sets ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" apart is its heart. The film explores themes of identity, family, and responsibility, and does so with a sincerity and depth that is rare in superhero movies. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with each Spider-Person bringing their own unique perspective and personality to the story.The voice acting is also top-notch, with Shameik Moore delivering a standout performance as Miles Morales. The supporting cast, including Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker and Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, also shines.Overall, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a triumph of animation and storytelling. It is a film that will appeal to both Spider-Man fans and general audiences alike, with its thrilling action, stunning visuals, and heartfelt themes. It is a must-see movie that sets a new standard for superhero films.",neutral
450,"This storyline could have been written in a single 2 hour production. Instead, we were led through a 2 1/2 hour production of half of a movie.It was bad enough that I kept looking around the theater and at my wife and whispering, come on let's move the storyline along a bit.I really enjoyed the first, but I honestly have no idea why there are so many perfect reviews for this one.There are some bright spots; parts of the animation, that I really enjoyed. I laughed a couple of times, as well.Overall, in terms of story, it's just a very average movie. And mostly, I avoid average movies.Maybe they'll get it write next time, but this time, I can't agree with everyone else on this one.",neutral
451,"The writers behind the Spiderverse movies are some of the best of our time. Not only do they know how to craft a unique, high-staked, deeply personal and riveting story, but their respect for the legacy of Spider-Man is beyond perfect.And that's all it takes, folks. For everyone and anyone whose working on preestablished franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, DC...), who want to follow up the adventures or stories in a robustly-built universe, all you need is to ""read up"". To understand what makes it work and use those strengths to your advantage.This movie is one of the best Spider-man stories I have ever seen. It's unlike any other told in the comics and movies, it's fresh, provocative (in the good way) and all out bonkers. Needless to say, the animation is top notch. I mean, Sony Animation Studios has developed into a powerhouse of stylised animation. It already showed in the trailers, but if you liked the different styles used in the animation of each spiderperson from other universe, you are going to have a fieldtrip with this one.Almost everything works in this movie, the comedy, the set pieces, the world-building, the emotional and dramatic moments. It's simply top tier cinema, not animated cinema alone, but overall cinema. The romantic tension, the new character's personalities and relationships, it's all around perfect, I would not change a thing.There's so many pros that I don't think I can put into words the amount of things this movie does right. The long action scenes, animation style, sound design and soundtrack, the script, the characterisation of old and new spider people. I have only praises for this movie. But the biggest one is what I said previously, the respect and understanding of the mythos and lore of Spider-man is what saves this movie for the bigger fans. Because Spider-man is not a hard story to adapt, but there's a lot of good stuff in it and the way the writters play with preestablished media and introducing new media to the people while not being too much to handle for the audience is brilliant.There're references for everyone, for those who saw only the movies, or the shows, or the games, or the tv shows, or the comics. I don't want to jump into spoilers, I just want to point out all the good qualities this movie has, that carries from the previous and some which are improved and amped to the max.Just the ambition of the story they are trying to tell here already surpases any and all expectations. I whole-heartedly believe they are breaking grounds here and they are changing the way the Spider-man universe works and I applaud their fantastic work. I hope the next one fulfills the catharsis that left me wanting more after the credits roled in this one.If anything, and I mean very mildly ruined the experience for me, that is, I lowered from a 10/10 to a 9/10, was two aspects that bugged me more than I expected. One of them is, you can tell this movie was divided in two while you watch it: the pacing is a bit slow in some scenes, action scenes that drag just a bit too much some times or emotional scenes that go on when all that was meant to be said was done. And the other aspect is, and this may be a bit spoilery, so if you don't wanna read more NOW IS THE TIME NOT TO READ MORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED:I think the prologue and recap of the previous movie at the beginning of this one wasn't too.. right. It threw me off a bit just because they went on for too long, like they tried to flesh out the background story of someone and, despite how this comes back full circle in the end, it just carries on and on it's a bit too long before we get to where everyone is. Also, and this is last spoilery thing, I feel there's a bit of a flaw of continuity when Gwen ""comes back to see Miles"", like between the ending of the previous movie, and this one. They didn't connect it too well I think (ahem, Miles seems different).",positive
452,"Across the Spider-Verse strikes the perfect chord, like a symphony of web-slinging hilarity. It swings through the cinematic landscape with impeccable pacing, juggling character development and action like a circus performer on caffeine. The voice acting is A-grade, with Isaac brooding so intensely that I could swear his voice could rival thunder. Hailee Steinfeld shines as Gwen, blending her previous roles into a cocktail of awesomeness. And let's not forget Moore, who's simply ""freaking amazing"" as Morales, showcasing maturity and immaturity in a way that would make even a hormonal spider proud. The storytelling is as fresh as a spider web spun by a hipster arachnid, blending nostalgia, comedy, and superheroism in a way that leaves you saying, ""Wow, superheroes can be deep and funny!"" The comedy is a riot, hitting you with more punchlines than a spider web has sticky threads, and the nostalgia and Easter eggs are like a treasure hunt for cinephiles and comic book aficionados. The action scenes are a step up from the first film, delivering more kicks, flips, and whips than a salsa dancing Spider-Man. The animation and art style are a visual feast, like watching a kaleidoscope of comic book pages come to life in a mind-bending acid trip. Sure, there are a few hiccups along the way, like some forced humor and moments of pacing hiccups, but hey, nobody's perfect, not even Spider-Man. The ending may drag on a bit, like that one friend who can't take a hint to leave the party, but it's still a wild ride that'll make you want to spin back for more. So grab your popcorn, slip into your Spidey suit, and get ready for an adventure that'll make you laugh, cheer, and leave you itching for the next installment. Spider-fans, this one's for you!",positive
453,"I went to the premier with high expectations and came back happy with a drill of anticipation for continuation. This film sets completely new standards from which every studio can learn something.FilmAt the beginning we dive into Gwen's world and shockingly you realize in disbelief how the animation has developed after 5 years. The graphics, transitions, transition of specific colors, the movement of the characters, facial expressions and the atmosphere is unbelievably good. I mean the first movie already made you feel you go through a comic, but Across The Spider-Verse is the next level of animation. With approximately 150.000.000$ budget the result is impressive and totally worth it. I loved every bit of it and no 140 minutes didn't fell too long. When the film was over I was like go on do another 2 hours I WANT MORE OF THIS. Huge respect to Chris Miller & Phil Lord and the entire crew for making this possible.The plot no spoilerIt takes place 16 months after the events of the fire movie. Miles Morales is Spider-Man and has to deal with the daily businesses. He struggles to keep his relationship with his parents, always comes late and has little to no time. One day he faces The Spot a new villain and from there I leave you out without spoilers. The Spot fits in this topic and movie so good. He was the right choice. His design is crazy and his motives are so well written.MultiverseI have to say Across The Spider-Verse did catch the Multiverse topic perfectly. MCU needs to note so many things here. It's actually insane how great they showed the possibilities, diversities and complexities of it. For me, they surpassed No Way Home in terms of Multiverse. Of course Animation is a different tool, but still the story telling and how they made you feel like this movie is not only for kids it's actually more complex and for fans and more like for everyone. The concept of that was nailed perfect. You really do not feel twisted or lost like in several MCU Multiverse projects.To come to an conclusion I think it's safe to say this movie is gonna win another Oscar and is so far in a great cinema year for me the best movie. Wow, I'm so grateful for this movie. I want to watch it again. Go to the cinema right now. This is a true masterpiece. 10/10 Genre and overall everything was perfect. The voice actors did an amazing job too.",positive
454,"Across the Spider Verse is a very solid movie. It's not the masterpiece that the insane hype train would have you believe, but it's very good. As of right now, this movie has a higher IMDb score than some of the greatest movies of all time (Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, all the Lord of the Rings movies) and I don't really think it's deserved. I'm sure it will be a lot better to look back on once part two comes out, but as of right now it does feel like half of a movie. The animation and voice acting are both great, it has good action, and some of the references and visual gags were cool. I would recommend seeing this in the theater, but I'd say wait a few weeks. I saw it opening weekend in a theater packed full of drooling fanboys who cheered at every single reference. It was maybe the worst theater experience I've ever had. I don't think it's as great as the first but it was a good movie.",positive
455,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse surprised the hell out of me back in 2018. Not only was I shocked at how entertaining it was, but also how well-crafted the story was. So, of course, I was eagerly awaiting the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Well, it's now playing in theatres and I'm honestly still trying to process it all. I'm not sure if words will be able to truly explain how much I loved this movie, but let's give it a go.After the events of the previous instalment left the multiverse wide open for exploring, we pick up right where we leave off, sort of. The film opens with a bit of Gwen's backstory and then dives into the family dynamic of Miles Morales' story once again, which will always be a highlight of these movies for me. Visited by Gwen, Miles decides to enter the multiverse again, but this time the stakes are far higher and certain revelations send this story in a whole new direction. I couldn't believe my eyes and what was visually being told, especially in certain moments. As a Spider-Man fan, I was grinning like a kid from ear to ear. It also gets much darker by the end which really surprised me for a film aimed at a younger audience.Even more than the first film, the animation here tells the story just as much as the dialogue. Each world had its own unique visual style and it seamlessly blended together after my eyes adjusted. At first I found all the animation styles jarring, but then I ended up thinking it was masterfully done. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen and it's seriously a work of art to look at and experience. I'm absolutely blown away by the look of this film.On top of the incredible animation, this story is just far deeper and richer than the first and is more mature as well. This is a film made for adults, with a child-like look to it. The scenes that both pay homage to the past while moving this story forward were inspired and I can't wait to see where they help the story further even more. This was a true theatrical experience I won't forget for a while. Yes, the animation is amazing and the story is incredibly well thought out, but if it wasn't for the screenplay this film wouldn't have also had the emotional impact.Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Dave Callaham are a team that know exactly what they're doing here. I have full faith that the third film that closes out this trilogy will be just as good, simply because this film is very close to perfection for the story it was telling and I loved the first film too. Other than needing to adjust to the style a bit more than the first, I had zero complaints here and I haven't been able to say that about a movie in a while. If you can go along with the crazy visual style, I seriously can't recommend it enough. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now playing in theatres and I think I have a new favourite Spider-Man movie, as a well as it currently being my favourite movie so far in 2023. It's truly spectacular in every conceivable way, especially for the type of film it is.",positive
456,"Visuals 9/10
Storytelling 10/10
Musical Score 10/10
Characters 10/10Overall 10/10This sequel had next to no advertising and surprised me with it's arrival in cinemas. It just does not need any as the first installment set this sequel up to follow in some immensely successful footsteps.My only issue is that during one of the fight scenes, I could not follow what was happening because of the animation. But hey, it was still beautifully done! Everything else inclusive!The best storytelling by far as you have beautifully animated characters with lifelike emotional facial cues, deep and meaningful dialogue in every aspect of the story from very memorable characters and a near perfect musical score that plays to the beat of the oncreen action/drama.I also love that the multiverse is more than just the storyline for this movie. It includes the stories from all the Spider-Man iterations from over the years.The way each character old and new is re/introduced shows how much care went into this beautifully crafted movie. Entertainment from start to finish! Whether it be slow meaningful scenes up to the high paced action. Suitable for everyone of any age!",positive
457,"It is a pity that the film is not a complete story, it is cut abruptly just when the story begins to be interesting : some events are finally anticipated by the main character, whereas during the rest of the movie, the story feels very chaotic and the audience cannot anticipate much.It feels like it is an introduction for the real story, that will take place in the next installment. The title should have included ""Part one"" to avoid deceiving people.The first movie could at least stand by itself.The visual style is great, but it looks like it is heavily inspired by Japanese animated movie Promare (2019), regarding the colors and the framing of shots.",positive
458,"From its very first opening moments, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an undeniable work of art. A bigger, bolder sequel that's not afraid to take its time with its character's growth and truly understands the character. Exploring in extremely meta, reality bending fashion the true burden of being Spider-Man.Shameik Moore is once again perfect, he's able to portray how Miles has grown since the first film effortlessly and remains loveable. Hailee Steinfeld is even better than last time with the best arc of the film, its just as much her film as it is Miles. Jason Schwartzman is great as the Spot, able go from being a joke to a genuine threat in really convincing fashion.Out of the new Spider-people, Oscar Isaac brings a palpable anger to Miguel O'Hara that conveys the burden he has and the lengths he'll go to and Daniel Kaluuya is the best new addition as Hobie, an unashamedly British character with the strongest moral compass and never betrays it, making him an easy favourite.In the years since the original came out, a fair few films have clearly been inspired by its animation and put their own spin on it but directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Justin K. Thompson and Kemp Powers do an excellent job of reminding you nothing can compete with Spider-verse. Its the literal definition of every frame a painting and every new dimension is so vibrant and unique.The soundtrack and score by Daniel Pemberton remain highlights, maintaining a strong balance between the two but Pemberton has really outdone himself with this score. It brings back all the themes that were so unique and memorable whilst adding new ones that are equally strong, if not better.",positive
459,"I'm just tired of this Hollywood trend of TBC endings. ""Do you care about figuring out what happens next? Well you better shell out more cash"". I know you might be thinking ""hey wet blanket, they needed to draw out the story in order to tell it right!"" If you commissioned a painter to do a portrait of you only for them to deliver half a portrait on a full canvas informing you that you need to shell out more for the other half because it wouldn't fit you'd call bs. A professional writer can do this same thing with words, it's literally their job. I was loving this movie until I realized there was only 7 mins left and no end in sight. After that I could only think about all the tidbits in this whopping 2.5 hour movie that could have been cut (and probably added back into an extended directors cut later) to round out the story. Im not even saying they should have only made 2 movies. I'm just saying movies within a trilogy should also stand on their own. Imagine if empire strikes back ended as soon as Luke learned that Vader was his father. Sure you'd want to see the next movie but it also keeps the writers in a rigid story structure that HAS to pick up right where the last one left off. There's no room for new ideas or error. If something happens between now and the scheduled release date (which this is Hollywood so a studio exec could literally have a bad day and scrap the whole project) this movie that could have been a masterpiece is now just an unfinished piece of nothing.",neutral
460,"I really like the visual style, even though it needs some working to perfect. I like the real people blended inside the animation as well, those were pretty funny. Unfortunately, I think the negatives of this film outweigh its positives. The whole ""multiverse universe"" thing is getting pretty boring and outplayed especially for superhero movies. Additionally, I did not understand if the film was trying to portray Miguel as the bad guy. He is trying to literally stop Miles from destroying his entire universe/family out of pride that ""I can do anything I'm Spiderman"". Miguel seemed rational compared to Miles and I did not view him as villainous. I am going to predict that for the third movie, they are going to make Miles win over Miguel and the spot. Because ""Pride wins over everything and I can do both"". Unfortunately doesn't work like that in the real world but you can do it in fiction. Gwen as well, due to her not calling the Spider group and calling for help, spot got away from her. This gives a very dangerous message to unsuspecting minds that does not align with reality, but I think most adults can deduce it is fiction.",negative
461,"Today, I saw some of the most inventive, bold, and charming sequences I have ever witnessed on a big screen.Across the Spider-Verse sets up a huge amount of characters and plot devices, and it almost always does so with an astounding amount of grace, power, and wit.The internal conflicts given to Miles and Gwen are compelling, relatable, and emotionally wrenching. The first ten minutes of this movie alone made me feel more than most entire films I've seen all year.This takes the zany, colorful, creative action of the previous film and ups everything; the spectacle is thrilling and fast when it needs to be, but these filmmakers weren't afraid to pull back for small intimate character moments either.Admittedly, the movie does suffer from its need to set everything up for a big finale, as the story's two villains don't get nearly enough time or development to make the threat seem as big as it is. And the cliffhanger ending is, by its nature, unable to provide satisfying payoff for the things it sets up.So here I am, feeling like I just watched the first half of a masterful film, and though I'm not satisfied yet, I anxiously await part two. Because I was all in.",neutral
462,"Anyone into comics, superheroes or just animation general has no excuse to skip this.This just shames the MCU on levels that's not even aiming for.I'd say kids and adults can both easily enjoy it, because even if there are some themes that adults will clearly understand and appreciate more, it shows nothing that I'd consider to much for kid, in fact they'll probably enjoy it for the visual spectacle and jokes alone.It finds that good balance with comedy and drama, as every joke works, never overstay their welcome, and they never fall into the trap of breaking the dramatic scenes with a joke, or a great joke with a sudden dramatic tone. There's a clear break between the two elements.They manage to take the villain of the week and make a villain of the month out of it.And holy ... the easter eggs. I'm a big Spidey fan, and I've read, seen and played a lot of content related to him. I had a hard time keeping up with the fan service.",positive
463,"Let me warn you guys beforehand, this is sort of the 1st part of a 2-part story. Spiderman: Beyond The Spiderverse will arrive in March 2024.This movie was just downright brilliant. There's no other way to put it. I absolutely love the confidence with which this movie has been made. I don't just mean the style of the movie, because man, is it stylish. I also mean the time it takes to tell it's story. That's the confidence. To be sure about the time you want to take to tell a story that you think is going to be great, and not worry about whether some audience is going to lose interest or not. Because I do think that some people are going to be put off by the slowness of the 1st half. And it is admittedly slow. But I don't mind it at all. If any story deserved a slow pace it was this one. And when this movie speeds up, it really speeds up - One action set piece after another, lots of hilarious jokes thrown at you at high speed.They take their sweet time to build their characters and their problems. To make them as relatable as possible. I thought they nailed that. They understood the struggles of being spiderman - Having 2 identities, not being able to talk to anyone about it, hearing criticisms, unsure of what the right thing to do is - That's what made this movie so relatable. This time I was able to really root for Miles because of the time this movie took to explain his struggles, something I thought was rushed in the 1st movie.The soundtrack is brilliant, the direction is brilliant and the animation is one of the best in modern times. Like I said, this movie is STYLISH, just like the 1st one. There are a couple of action scenes here that are so, so thrilling, I could barely sit still. The plot twists towards the end were great too.Watch this movie in theatres guys, it deserves your money. And you're going to have a spectacular time, trust me. As of now, this might be the best movie I've seen this year. I'm just over the moon by the fact that we are getting such a great franchise. This truly is the perfect summer blockbuster.",positive
464,"Soooo where do I start...after watching the film 2x so far back to back days & going again for a 3rd time. I think back to the 1st film. Before the film started I asked myself HOW? HOW in the hell is SONY going to top the 1st entry to Miles. We know SONY has mishandled their Spidey IP in the live action department with a few given exceptions...So as I watched Gwen's story pulled LITERALLY from the comics to big screen & watched Spider-India, Spider-Punk with a twist,Scarlet Spider & the PLETHORA of Spidey characters in all its MAGNIFICENCE hit the screen. At the end of the film I answered my own question...THIS!..THIS IS HOW THEY DO IT! & I'll be damned, they SURELY did. The various art animation styles, the color palette usage, when they focused on each specific Spidey character at the time. The story arc being told & arcs they pulled from, with that creme de la creme twist myself & my son picked out once we saw Mile's mom face & knew immediately where they were going...perfection...left you begging for more. You could've told me to sit there for another 2 1/2 hrs & I would have not mind AT ALL. Knowing ahead of time this was always a 2 part film already had me excited, EVEN MORE after that ending. The group that was assembled towards the end my my my goodness. The gems of Easter eggs ontop of Easter eggs & other get you amped up surprises. At its core it had its drama & deep family story to tell, it had action, it had comedy it had suspense, it had it all, but 1st & foremost, the CORE concepts of what makes Spider-Man..Spider-Man, were showcased through & through. You can tell from the director, down to every single person/department involved with these 2 films well 3 üòèhopefully soon thoroughly love the character/characters.",positive
465,"Everything about this movie is amazing. The animation was greatly improved, and you can see. The movie itself is a wonderful idea. The way they left the fans on a cliff hanger was crazy!The way Miles forgot about his spider being from a different universe was a huge plot twist. Also us ( the viewer ) not knowing that Mile's spider was not meant to bite him, but instead a different Miles from a different universe was top notch.As well, the story of the other characters including Gwen and Peter. It was cool that before any real action happens we can catch up on all the other characters before we learn what happens. Well this movie was wonderful and I truly can't wait for the third one!",positive
466,Okay so first of all: 1000/10 on the animation. That was probably the best animated movie I've ever seen. But the story line didn't make a lot of sense and was very chaotic. It has so many ideas and most of them were... Okay but trying to put all of them in one movie? That's quite the challenge. And u didn't really love Gwen's backstory. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me and I feel like the movie would've been a bit better off without it. And making two parts made it feel like a TV show which didn't sit well with me. I feel like Spider Man Across the Spiderverse should have been it. I did not like the fact that a sequel was created. Or a triquel.,positive
467,"This movie is overrated. Yes the animation is fantastic and there are some dramatic posing scenes including the ending that are among the best I have seen in any movie in my 55+ years of movie attendence... However the plot is very poorly assembled - the motivations of the characters are not fully known and one of the primary quests of the hero does not get assigned until 2/3 of the way through the movie which is just very very sloppy writing! The relationship between the teenagers and their parents is very important but there are no establishing scenes for this and it is very stereotypical and badly done! My favorite Spider-Man movies are the first animated spider-verse movie and Spider-Man 2 so I don't think I am abnormal among Spider-Man fans I've been reading Spider-Man comic books since I was six but have not read the spider-verse ones. Also I was really upset not to see spider pig, one of my favorite characters from the first movie! And there is one particular fight scene 2/3 the way through the movie that just drags on and on and on it's like avengers Infinity war where you get the message 20 minutes of the movie then no matter what Thanos always wins in this movie so why torture the audience for 30 minutes with his fight scene? I myself got bored and was going to go to the restroom and then come to find out this is a two-part movie and they were just stretching the story to make space for an early ending without satisfying the hero's journey! So actually I rate it 10+ for animation but 4+ for story and that averages out to 7.",neutral
468,"""Across the Spider-Verse"" it's, probably, the best Spider-Man movie ever made, and has the best cliffhanger in a movie since ""Infinity War"".Miles Morales is a truly empowered character, and his evolution it's simply awesome.All the Spider-Men have great moments, and the OST it's so accurate.Furthermore, the animation in this movie is on another level. Graphics it's so beautiful and original. Every Spider-Man have his own personality that it shows trough special animation for each one.The new characters are amazing, specially Miguel O' Hara and Spider-Punk.In the other hand, there are some scenes that could be so much to the spectators because it have so many details. But all of this is completely worth it.Can't wait for the epic conclusion for the best Spider-Man trilogy, ever.",positive
469,"Truly a spectacular visual experience...can appreciate the work and skills that went into it. But it's just too much, it's a showcase of what's possible (still very impressive). The concept and idea of it is unique though....but I must be honest. Looking through those awesome visual layers I am not so enthusiastic..the fact that it's so hyped makes the disappointing even bigger.Story wise I don't think its that interesting and above all its totally not convincing to see Miles doing what he does (sorry can't be more specific without spoiling) hahah. Normally colors, camera angles, distortions etc have a purpose in film and gives a sense of time, emotion, tension, intimacy, danger etc. But this is like watching a film on steroids and therefore missing all these things ..because of the overkill of it.Nevertheless..if I had to judge it for its animation only it deserves a perfect ten.",neutral
470,"This movie was convoluted as a it could be.First 10 minutes are set up for gwen.Next 35 minutes are set up for Multiverse.Next 30 minutes are set up for Miles's actual story arch.We finally arrive at the rising action about 1 hr and 30 minutes into the movie. With climax being...dun dun dun...to be continued.This movie was awful.They over played the art style. Like really, each universe needs its own art style. Truth be told it detracted from the story. I had to revisit portions because I was taking out of the story by the obnoxious flickering and flowing colors. It worked in the last one cause you used one back ground. But when the background becomes a character...you have no story.And whats more, your main villain is a good guy who will switch to reluctantly following Miles in the next film...who knows, maybe even laying his life down cause Miles made him a believer.YAWN!!! I had to switch to different activities 4 times in this movie because that is how unwatchable this film is.The one compelling character, Spider-punk, was so authentic he is incomprehensible by american audiences. I watch tons of english set films, but they literally had spider-punk mumble his cockney. Absolutely the worst spiderman film ever.",negative
471,"Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse was one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. Everything about this long awaited sequel was absolute perfection. All of the characters were extremely unique. The comedy was perfectly placed throughout the entire movie. The animation was flawless.The plot was amazing and was not rushed at all. Although a little more complex of a plot than the first movie, I think they explained it thoroughly so everyone of all ages would understand. At the end of the movie, the cliff-hanger was executed seamlessly.I loved the references they made to past Spiderman movies and how they introduced so many different Spider-people from different universes. It was so fun to see and meet some of them. The way they mixed animation styles gave the story so much more depth.Overall, Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse is worth it and I am extremely excited to watch the the third movie.",positive
472,"Across the Spider-Verse is a masterful example of taking a well-known genre and making so many modifications that just watching it can be mind blowing.This is the deepest and best Spiderman story I've ever watched.It is like a philosophical mediation on what it means to be Spiderman and why Spiderman means so much to so many young people.It raises so many questions;

Artful mind altering ride it isStrong on message, even I got the don't let anyone ever tell you you don't belong buzz, but it felt sincere and earned. The messaging comes a clear second to the VISUALS.. it's like an LSD fuelled assault on your (spidey) senses that very nearly felt like too much, but redeems itself with some beautifully crafted slower sequences where your eyes finally get to rest and savour the astonishing art direction.I only have one complaint. I missed having subtitles. Sometimes there's so much sound I couldn't quite hear the dialogue.No matter. Just drink in the gorgeous chaos and walk unsteadily home afterwards.",positive
474,"This movie knocks it out of the park just like the first. Easily the second best marvel related movie of the year right behind Guardians 3. I felt true escapism watching this, there were no jarring points where something about real world news or politics pulled me out of the story. I was immersed, and the twists were great!I highly recommend you see this if you liked the first one, you will not be disappointed!Also while the original movie buzz was ""Oh they are doing insane pandering and changing characters"" This is likely the only marvel movie other than Guardians 3 that had none of that.",positive
475,"It's clear this film was made with a lot of love and care. Every aspect of it is carefully selected and perfected - from the colour palettes to the music and artwork itself.Into the Spiderverse has revolutionized animation in film. Many other films, even from other studios, were trying to recreate the magic of films like Up and other Pixar movies. So the artwork and overall style were all the same. Animation is a medium that can and should be unique and creative. Your imagination (and budget) are the only limits. Into the Spiderverse innovated the medium and now many other films are trying to be as equally fresh. I know that this film and the third installment will continue to remind us why animation in film can be great.Do yourself a favour and watch it with led lights synced to your screen. This is the perfect film to use it for. The colours contribute to the context of the film and mood so this will enhance your viewing experience.I can't wait for the third film.",positive
476,"Pretty good. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an exhilarating and visually stunning animated film that catapults audiences back into the multiverse. Picking up where the first installment left off, the sequel explores new dimensions and introduces new spider-heroes with their own unique stories. The animation style is a breathtaking fusion of vibrant colors and dynamic comic book panels, immersing viewers in a surreal and electrifying world. The film seamlessly blends heart-pounding action sequences with heartfelt character development, delivering a captivating narrative that effortlessly balances humor and emotional depth. The voice performances are exceptional, breathing life into each character and creating a genuine connection with the audience. The soundtrack is an auditory delight, complementing the high-energy scenes and enhancing the overall experience. With its bold storytelling, mesmerizing visuals, and infectious spirit, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a triumphant continuation of the franchise that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment.",positive
477,"One of the best animation movies ever.The main character
The side characters
The antagonist
The animation
The story
This movie had it all
If the third part is done well spiderverse trilogy can be one the best trilogies out there
I am so excited for the next part
The Prowler twist was also really good
This is probably the best cbm released this year
The climax was really good
The only slight issue I have with this one is that I'm gonna have to wait another year to see how the story ends ðŸ˜­ but it's alright I want the makers to take their time and give us the perfect Spiderman trilogy like the dark knight trilogy is for batman.",positive
478,"I needed to watch a good Spider-Man movie after seeing the incredibly disappointing ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" in 2021. Unlike most people, I didn't really enjoy the third Tom Holland Spider-Man movie, but that's for another review.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is, indeed, a pretty good Spider-Man movie. It certainly is an improvement over its predecessor when it comes to animation and visual style. It feels a lot more energetic than the previous movie.The story is not great, though. There were certain scenes in the movie that I simply wasn't interested in. Maybe that was because of the pacing. I didn't dislike the story, but it certainly wasn't impressive in my opinion.The villain they chose for this movie was pretty interesting and I already knew him from ""Spider-Man: The Animated Series"". The problem that I have is that, in spite of his impressive abilities, he didn't feel like a threat.This movie also references a lot of other Spider-Man movies, TV shows and even games. Unlike the references in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"", which felt forced and made me roll my eyes, the references in this movie didn't bother me at all. This was fan service done right.Overall, I really liked this movie. The animation was awesome, there were some great character moments and there was lot of effort put into this movie.7/10.",positive
479,"A simple Spider-Man cartoon. Can't you just make a simple Spider-man cartoon like the ones we saw during Stan Lee's early career. I'm talking about the 1967-1981. The 1981 Spider-Man cartoons were the best: a bridge between the old and new.Then we had the relatively good 1990 Spider-Man animated series. What I've just listed are the best along with the live action first three Spider-Man movies starring Nicholas Hammond: Spider-Man 1977, Spider-Man Strikes Back 1978 and Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge 1981. Tears fall from my eyes as I recollect watching Spider-Man 1977 shown to us by our teacher in playschool. I was a little nipper but the Spider-Man character stuck in my memory and later reinforced by the 1981 cartoons I used to see in the afternoon after school.How people forget Nicholas Hammond was the first and best actor to play Spider-Man. Like John Wesley Shipp who played The Flash in the 1990 series. Truth is that the film industry wants you to forget these people ever existed. It is quite a shame that John Wesley Shipp who looks strikingly like Bruce Campbell never rose to fame. Indeed I would have like these two to star alongside each other in a Sam Raimi directed movie.Plot of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miles goes on an adventure with Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman across the multiverse where he meets a team of Spider-People known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara/ Spider-Man 2099, but comes into conflict with them over handling a new threat in the form of the Spot.Verdict: just watched about 30 minutes and couldn't handle any more of it. Ironically I thought the previous installment made in 2018 was a much coherent plot and worth watching. Also I'm a staunch supporter of the original 1967 Peter Parker character created by Stan Lee who was a newspaper photographer. So why change???",positive
480,"I had tried to stay away from trailers to avoid as much as I can and wow, I am blown away.The story is good, it's a follow up to the previous where Miles is still struggling to balance the spider life and being a kid, he is missing his multiverse friends and especially Gwen. The movie really gets going when a new villain called spot who can travel through holes to anywhere is demolished by miles and insulted. He plans to grow his powers, creating the ability to multiverse travel. The story goes on and it's hard to say as it continues after spoilers but things MUST happen but Miles can't accept it.The animation was AMAZING,seeing miles and Gwen swing through NY was perfect, it goes along with a pitch perfect score, there was once or twice the voices were quite low behind the music but that could have been the cinema. I also love that there are 2 major different sides when it comes to Miles and Spider-Man 2099, and I can 100% see both sides !!!Obviously it's around Miles but this movie is equally Gwens movie, she has gone through and is going through a lot. The supporting characters were all great and this movie is genuinely funny.This is not a spoiler but the movie ends on a cliffhanger and the third movie is scheduled for next year. This doesn't take away from the movie, it leaves me wanting more in a good way, 9/10.",positive
481,"This Spider-Man sequeal surpassed all my high espectations that arrive the cinema with I and my friend.This sequeal has all people enjoy and want in a cartoon Spiderman movie. There are Great and simpatic character (Also villians), a gorgeous cartoon animation with wonderful colors and unique and very personalized effects of each character.The continuous trama, a spiderVerse full of new faces completly unique eacho one with a perfect cared design madre by a different graphic designer. I personaly considere that the SpiderVerse is one of the greatest MetaVerses.This is because in This movie, character are so cared each one from Sony Pictures.The only thing I regret about the movie is that it has an ending.",positive
482,"I love it it's my favorite movie EVER If I could rate it higher than 10 this is my rating 1000000000000000000000/10.It can be recommended for people from 10 years to 70I LOVE when All the Spidermen get confused about who to chase and I LOVE starting with the drums. BUT if you can become very sensitive about loss in the film, you don't have to watch when the whole group fails Miles and I had that myself.My whole family LOVES Spiderpunk And the Indian Spiderman.It's a mega cool animation and good choice of songs.It's quite long, but I like itYou MUST have seen the episode to be able to understand the plot, but fortunately the episode is good.",positive
483,"I personally loved the film, and I think it is one of the best animated films ever made. I was blown away by the animation, the story, the characters, and the music. I think the film is a masterpiece of creativity and innovation, and it shows how much potential there is in animation as a medium.I especially liked how the film explored the relationship between Miles and Gwen, and how they grew as characters and as spider-people. I think they have great chemistry and dynamics, and I was rooting for them throughout the film. I also liked how the film introduced new spider-people, such as Miguel, Jess, and Karan, and how they added more diversity and fun to the spider-team.I also appreciated how the film dealt with the theme of multiverse, and how it showed the different possibilities and consequences of traveling through dimensions. I think the film did a great job of balancing the sci-fi elements with the emotional ones, and how it made me care about each dimension and its inhabitants.The film also had some amazing action scenes, that were thrilling and exciting to watch. I especially liked the final showdown between Miles and the Spot, which was epic and intense. The film also had some hilarious moments, that made me laugh out loud. I especially liked Peter B. Parker's scenes, which were always funny and charming.",positive
484,Watched the movie in cinema and now on stream. Each time I really expected to have the first movie higher ranked because it's one of my favorite Comicbook movies of all time. But part 2 of this amazing series just amazes me with the stunning animation and its brilliant musical choice. The lightning and shadowing in each frame is well thought out as well as the writing of the dialogue. This movie contains one of my favorite chase scenes in cinema history and the many plot twist throughout the entire movie made it truly unforgettable the first time viewed in cinema. On the second watch you spot many differences and especially Easter eggs you missed out in the cinema. I used to grow up watching the Spider-Man movies with Peter Parker and with Miles Morales the franchise just got a brilliant addition of character. His development in the first movie blew me away(a leap of faith) but AtSV just cemented his characters to one of my favorites in fiction. That's how you write PoC with realistic problems and real even more realistic challenges. Undermine it with a phanomenal sidecast of characters and you have the perfect sequel which acts as a great build up movie for the third one.,positive
485,"Fantastic movie with well-written emotional scenes between truly outrageous and gorgeous action throughout. I reduce my score only because the movie is a secret two-parter with no real conclusion and just a big cliff-hanger. I don't like being manipulated in this way, but perhaps the scenes we got would have been reduced in quality, had they not. I'd love studios to be more forth-coming with this, though they wont since it would cause many to skip the theater and wait to see this one at home. Despite this, it's definitely worth seeing in a quality theater. No regrets there.The movie surpasses the original, primarily for not having to retell the origin story or lean so heavily into coming of age stuff we've had way too many movies of. The characters are already established and it finds a new path and plot with more interest.",positive
486,"Extremly bloated run-time and they really fumbled that pacing of the movie. You could watch only the last 40 minutes of this movie, and hardly miss a single important detail.I went into seeing this movie with high hopes of it being almost as good as the first one. I'm a critical fan of the super hero movie genre and Into the Spider-Verse was honestly an amazing movie.Across the Spider-Verse however spends WAY WAY too long overdeveloping characters and diving into back stories in slow-mo. The Gwen Stacy character is a phenomenal one, and they really just should have committed to making this movie about her, instead of killing the pace by not doing it justice. They spend many minutes on the most bland of details trying to pull out your emotional connection, but then blow by amazing story lines with a 5 second synopsis: ""Oh ya, this whole cool thing happened that could have been a movie on it's one""I think this movie is really probably a 6/10, but I gave it some extra love because of how amazing their take on animation and storytelling is. I've watched the first movie with my kids probably about 20 times since it came out.... I probably won't watch this one more than once.",positive
487,"It is horrible that this movie wasn't released earlier.It's just phenomenal how perfect it is. The artistic direction, the animation, the backgrounds, the soundtrack (oh my god metro boomin i love you) , the characters, the plot, the foreshadowing: EVERYTHING IS SO GORGEOUS AND PERFECT! It is the GREATEST animated movie of all time, the GREATEST spider-man movie of all time and one of the best super heroe movie you can see.I absolutely love Gwen's development and the role she played in this movie. Like almost every other character, who are so well-written. And of course, my favorite is Spider-Punk.The animation is just fabulous. I was so amazed at how they used so many animation styles and made the transition between them so fluid and natural. The 3D/2D mix is groundbreaking and requires so much skill and mastery. I had high expectations, and the movie was so much better than what I was waiting for. I was not ready.If you guys haven't seen it, you totaly should because ""Across the Spider-Verse"" isn't just a movie, it's an experience.",positive
488,"I'm going to divide my review into pros and cons:PROS:
This film is one of the very few successes of marvel's franchise following endgame. In a pretty long slough of mostly bad and horrible movies (Eternals, Love and thunder, etc. ), this movie certainly stands out!The visuals are out of this world! The way the animators used colors and geometry in the film was fantastic. A few examples of this are when Gwen hugs her father, and the background subtly changed from a dark room, to a colorful and bright apartment. The subtle reflection of purple onto Aaron Davis' face hints to his superhero identity. The way that Miles does not have his mask on, yet in his reflection he does hints to his secret identity and the duality of his lifestyle, while they also do the same thing with Gwen. Also, how the Spot begins as predominantly white with a couple black spots and ends consumed in black is an amazing symbol as it parallels his metamorphosis into a true villain from a less than optimal villain.Also, I usually prefer a more realistic animation, but I loved the minimalistic geometry in the animation that sheded light on the story. And the upside down shots of NY were awesome! The visuals and themes were certainly the highlight of the film.CONS: I understand how many people are dumbfounded by the visuals, to be fair, I am too, however I think this forces a lot of people to overlook the storyline. The story just didn't feel super developed, I feel like for a pretty long movie, not much happened. I was confused on the inner workings of the multiverse, and I feel like all of that wasn't explained super well. I was confused on how he had two different universes with the exact same people in them, but he took an alternate life path. I felt like the story never gained momentum which resulted in me not really having much anticipation for the next one. I feel like they could have explained more, and done better with the plot, because it became such a shock to me when it said ""to be continued"". I love the visuals, but feel like the storyline was lacking. Maybe it will all come together in the next movie, but this one was certainly overrated. Also this is a much darker film to have a PG rating, which I like a lot, but younger kids might not. I love the movie, but it's pretty overrated. Hopefully the next film will develop the story and finish it off strong.",positive
489,"There are spoilers, and this is it. To be continued. 2.5 hours of vagueness and ""to be continued""!!!!The plot was vague. Girl misses boy. There's a world of spider men, women. Basically they all have to suffer the same crushing blows, I.e uncles, fathers die or their universe's implode. Ffs.Then for a twist no one cares about, the spider that bite Miles was from another universe so he wasnt meant to be bitten and has to be contained by the spidermen/women.It blissful wraps up with Mile in the universe his spider came from were there was no Miles and the Miles there is bad.There is a villain, he is underdeveloped and boring. His very existence is based of some crap clear thought up from a board meeting or a long time spent on the toilet.Underwhelming is a massive understatement.",negative
490,"If you think this Spider-Man movie is bad, you're so wrong on so many levels. Even the reasons you give are not backed up with any evidence whatsoever. And when you do back it ip with evidence, it sounds ridiculous. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is the. Best Spider-Man movie ever made since no way home. Heck, I dare say it even tops the already good Into The Spider-Verse movie. So don't say this movie is bad, a waste of time, too long, or that it has any issues with pace. Because it has NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. None. Zero. (The ones I mentioned in commas) this movie is good. No issues with pacing or anything like that.",neutral
491,"I have never left a review on here even though I've seen many great movies over my 30+ years of living but this movie absolutely deserved a review from me. It had me drawn in from beginning to the end. I was smiling from ear to ear. Into The Spider-Verse was great but this movie was absolutely AMAZING. I rate this above Endgame and Infinity War. It definitely gets a 10 out of 10 from me. If Beyond The Spider-Verse can top, I'll probably cry. Lol. I was burnt out on Marvel live action movies and this movie was so refreshing. I watched it twice and will probably watch it again. To the people who created this music, I thank you. You did an amazing job.",positive
492,"'Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse' might be the most visually ambitious/creative/spectacular movie I've ever seen. It's WILD how visually stimulating this movie really is. It's decadently rich, complex and layered and it earns every second of it. Flawless performances and whip smart dialogues and beautiful songs accompanied with next level visuals that are nothing short of breathtaking. It luxuriates in its bold creative choices and delivers a bounty of treats. In conclusion, the film is a piece of art that will leave a lasting impression on viewers, as it surpasses every criterion of making a perfect Spider-Man movie.",positive
493,"I wish I could explain the emotions and joy when I watching it.From conversation to the action, you guys make me fall in love to Spider Man again. Thank you for all the crew, you really made a masterpiece.All this small talks with Rio Morales and Miles at the roof top, Gwen with her father, when she came home and figure out he is not captan, that makes me feel emotional a little bit. Few other moneys as well :))
And you'll love spider cat , he is adorable, even for a short time.Twists are as always unexpected but so good so I got goosebumps, definitely watch with friends. It has to me more enjoyable. I couldn't make it out with them so have to watch it on my own. Yet still enjoyed.",positive
494,"I found myself in awe at all of the colors and character designs, and was especially impressed by all the references and easter-eggs to other Spider-Man media and content. The spot is such an interesting Villain who I genuinely didn't expect to appear in this film, I was predicting many other types of alternate Spider-Man villains like Olivia Octavius- And he was a very fun edition.Back to the colors and character designs as I mentioned before, I was in love with the art styles that came along with each new character. Watching the watercolor drip behind Gwen back in her reality as she gets more and more emotional was an experience I didn't think I'd love that much.",positive
495,"Whatever Sony is giving to their writers and artists and whomever else...keep DOING IT! Without spoilers this movie is fire. Emotions are out of control. Characters get backstories worthy enough to draw you in. Comedy is light hearted but I swear I was tearing up multiple times to the bitter end. I thought Into the Spider-Verse was gold and would've been happy as a stand alone in hopes that if there was a sequel it would be just as good, but this film, I would say, gave the audience everything and more. With everything kinda feeling bleh in cinema these days it's always a gem to see such a popular franchise meet more than the fan's expectations. When more than just a few people rate something 10/10, it has to mean something. See this movie in theaters! Do IT!",neutral
496,"How does one try to top a first movie that was exceptionally good? Well, for one, give viewers an overdose of what made the original such a good watch. And in Spider-Man:Across the Spider-Verse, it's just loaded with an overkill of hip hop and comic book style story telling.Just to be sure, Across the Spider-verse is a good movie, and a worthy follow up to the first. While filled with the usual Spiderman trope such as teen - superhero angst, or, ""with great responsibility comes great power"", it makes up the rest of the narrative with exceptional emotive content, backed up by over the top animation and use of comic style colours, and spot-on voice acting.What I feel the directors and writers should have done is to curb their impulse to indulge on the soundtrack - especially hip hop, and the use of comic book style. There's a song for practically every scene change for the first thirty or so minutes. While this dissipates as the movie progresses, it doesn't altogether disappear.But it's the over-use of comic style framing and captioning that gets in the way of letting the viewer to gently seep it in, especially during the action scenes, which are already playing out at break neck speed; it just becomes overwhelming after a while, to keep pace when there's an overload of come book caption boxes or screen splits. It's makes it hard to keep track of who's who, and where's where. Perhaps the directors and writers are aware of this, and that could explain the two hours and twenty minute length of the movie; they just had to find time through the overload to find additional time to allow the narrative to flow through.But if your eyes and brains could adjust to the pace of things being flashed out on the screen, then there's no reason for you not to enjoy Across the Spider-verse; it's emotional core is strong enough to keep you invested all the way to the end, and ultimately to anticipate the sequel.",positive
497,"An amazingly animated film that adds on a great meta narrative. The score is amazing and it was sensory overload in the best possible way.The way backgrounds, shading, and movement and momentum are used in the film push animations boundaries. The film is also so imaginative and its plot has so many fantastic beat shifts and twists that are set up so well and pay off so well. There is a classic spiderman scene that plays out that goes differently than spiderman stories go; but it was a great set up to a twist that plays into the film's central themes.I love this film just like I did the first one. And it has a classic comic book ending.Beyond the Spiderverse, part 2 of this film, is expected to come out March 2023. Let's hope that happens, because I need more.",positive
498,"Okay this movie was great and I did enjoy it. But I still felt a bit empty afterwards. No, not cuz of the cliffhanger, I was expecting that given this is a trilogy. But cuz...it lacks the charm of the first one.The first one was fun, jovial, goofy, hectic, and intense. This one is more intense and hectic with some goof on the side.Also quite dark and complex (like dang... inevitable deaths you can't prevent, that's hefty stuff). I personally don't care but this is definitely not for kids under 10. Heck maybe under 12. It's not cuz it's ""mature"" but....just intricate. Well done for sure, but not something an average kid would really appreciate or understand in my opinion.Ok time to be nit-picky. I didn't like the constant color shifts for Gwen's personal scenes because they were so disorienting visually. Yeah sure, trying to be artistic, but that's overkill.I really didn't like the extended untranslated Spanish in the film. A few phrases here and there is totally fine. I like it when they keep it natural and don't translate. But when you start using longer sentences during intimate moments of the movie, and you don't bother to translate for audience (and we ain't all Spanish speaking), I just felt so....excluded. They could've had some funny funky subtitles to translate. They really could've! Nothing stopped them from translating the snippets of Hindi (or whatever Indian language they used, sorry idk)!!There are a few side things like blatant political and commercial ""product placement"" that miffed me, but that's no biggie. Also wasn't a fan of the implications of miles/gwen romance....just stay friends....Overall a fun crazy movie. But...honestly. The first one is better.",neutral
499,"I really can't understand how this movie got such a high rating ... higher than Interstellar, seriously ?The pace alternates between (very) high frequency frenesy and cheesy parent-child emotional parts.In the first part the main hero can't stay in place for more than 1 minute.And then he goes into a spideman world where everyone seems to be in total vacation (do they have a clone to do thier past job?), only happy to be there and not at all disturbed every minute by a life-and-death crisis.I left it when the hero was accused to save someone that shouldn't be saved ... how does it make sense that just one or two lives have such an impact when they all spidermen do that all day long ?How could they monitor all the spidermen multiverse activities to verify this ?Plus the villain really pityfull, you can't have a bit of empathy with his cheap problems.",neutral
500,"No puns intended - and yes it is plural! So many things that are touched upon .. same is true for the movie. There is so much, that watching this once is not enough. While it has been a while since I saw the first (or rather previous) movie, it is not entirely necessary to have seen it. On the other hand, you will have some callbacks, if you have seen it. Maybe even more if you watch them back to back.The character are well drawn (no pun here, not an entirely intended one at least) - and talking of drawn: I remember that the first movie had one style throughout the movie. This combines many styles (and universes/worlds) ... which suits the movie well. You have so many characters (some returning, but also quite a few new ones) .. and you have the old ones ""evolving"" to a degree. Still stuck - still trying to handle their situation, still struggling with having a ""normal"" life and being the superhero their city deserves (well let's assume that is the case).Cameos are here - and this is all over the place (ok that can be found guilty of being a pun) - we get references of so many things. Me not being as familiar as other when it comes to Spiderman comics ... I assume there are even more in jokes here that I was not able to comprehend or even detect. Twists are here to stay and the trailer did not really give away too much - so no finger pointing (I had to - as did the movie).Dialog is great - and quite fast paced! It does not leave you with room to breathe ... but it is tight and it works. And it also is helping that the voice cast is as good as one can imagine. The multiverse is here to stay - or you know switch around, fighting the good fight ... what I did not know: the movie is only part of a larger story ... so do not be surprised if the movie leaves you wanting more at the end ... to quote the movie: to be continued (thankfully the sequel is coming next year)",positive
501,"The first hour is a waste of an hour. The first hour is filled with messy boring actions with bad music, continuously blabbering. The second hour is where the real fun begins but they have to split the ""fun"" part into two films because they wasted the first hour for nothing. Seriously, do we have to watch Miles constantly late for something because he was fighting Spot and getting life lessons from his parents for an hour straight? Music, imo, was awful, messy and annoying. I liked the first file vastly better than this one. I almost give up in first 30 minutes because there was just nothing interesting but I keep telling myself that there must be something exciting for this to get 9.0 score, well, second half of the movie is fun but 9.0 score? Nope, a 5.",negative
502,"I loved this movie but can we stop with the 2 part finale's. There's nothing more disappointing then watching a phenomenal first 2 acts, only for the movie to end right as it gets into the final act.Otherwise this movie is excellent. There are tons of great references to previous Spider-Man iterations. It's clear that the people work on this film care for and understand the character of Spider-Man. (Unlike the current Spider-Man comic writers)This movie is like a love letter to Spider-Man and I look forward to finding out how this story ends. I'm just disappointed that yet another franchise is going for the 2 part finale which is a trope that I was never a fan of as I know the reason studios do this is usually because it's a way to make more money and rarely because the story demands it.",positive
503,"I absolutely love the first one and the fact I know so many people who are not into animated movies or comics who also found it great is a testament to its quality. So I went in this second chapter optimistically hoping they wouldn't mess up trying to emulate the first one; I certainly didn't think it would be equally good. And to my utmost surprise it's actually... better. It surpasses it in every way: the visuals of course but also the depth of the story and the writing that goes along, voice acting of course, terrific score, and just overall directing. 2.5 hours just went like that *snaps fingers* and since I didn't know it was planned to be a trilogy I let out a very loud ""Noooooo!"" when the words To Be Continued appeared as it felt like I was only 30 minutes in. If Beyond the Spider-verse ends up being as good (or dare I say it... better?) this will go down as one of the most perfect and impressive trilogies ever made. Oh yeah, highly recommended, in case that wasn't clear haha.",positive
504,"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a dazzling sequel that takes Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy on a multiverse-hopping adventure with a new team of Spider-People. The film expands the Spider-Verse in creative and exciting ways, introducing new characters, worlds and threats, while also exploring Miles' personal journey as a hero and a friend.The film follows Miles (Shameik Moore), who is still learning to be Spider-Man and has feelings for Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld). He is recruited by her to join a mission to stop the Spot (Jason Schwartzman), a villain who can open portals to different dimensions. Along the way, Miles meets Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), who leads a group of Spider-People from different universes known as spider-society. However, Miles soon clashes with Miguel and his group over how to handle the Spot and his mysterious plan.The film is a visual spectacle, with amazing animation that displays the diversity and creativity of the Spider-Verse. Each universe has its own flair and mood. The action sequences are exciting and original, using the Spot's portals to create dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. The film also nods to various Spider-Man comics, movies and shows, with references and Easter eggs that will please fans.The voice cast is excellent, with Moore and Steinfeld returning as Miles and Gwen with charisma and chemistry. Isaac shines as Miguel, who acts as a mentor and rival to Miles, while Schwartzman is a charming and threatening villain as the Spot. The supporting cast is also remarkable, with each Spider-Person adding their own humor and personality to the mix. The film also welcomes back Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, Brian Tyree Henry as Jefferson Morales, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales and introduces new cast members such as Issa Rae as Jessica Drew / Spider-Woman, Karan Soni as Pavitr Prabhakar / Spider-Man India, Daniel Kaluuya as Hobart ""Hobie"" Brown / Spider-Punk, Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara / Spider-Man 2099, and many more cameos.The film is not only a spectacle, but also a heartfelt story that explores Miles' growth as a hero and a person. The film delves into his struggles with balancing his personal life and his duty as Spider-Man, his relationship with Gwen and his family, and his sense of belonging in the multiverse. The film also examines the themes of identity and responsibility that are central to the Spider-Man mythos, showing how each Spider-Person has their own challenges and motivations. The film also celebrates the diversity and unity of the Spider-Verse, showing how different people can share a common bond through their love of being Spider-People.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is an amazing sequel that will captivate you from start to finish. It combines stunning visuals, emotional depth, and a mind-blowing plot that takes you to new dimensions of storytelling. It is a cinematic masterpiece that you don't want to miss on the big screen.",positive
505,"This review will be the first I've seen that isn't 10 stars and I hate to feel like a contrarian but this movie, in my opinion, did not quite live up to my expectations. It was beautifully animated, and it has elements that could have made it the greatest Spider-Man movie of all time. However, compared to ""Into the Spider-Verse"", which is quite possibly one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen, it suffers from some serious flaws that took me out of the experience and have been nagging me ever since. So let me break down both the pros and cons.Pros: Beautiful animation. Amazing soundtrack. The opening exploring Gwen's backstory and giving her character more weight is expertly done. Miles' relationship with his family is further expanded upon and made me feel even more invested than in the last movie. Spider-Man 2099 as an antagonist is an amazing character, reminding me of Thanos in some ways as they are both men trying to do what they believe is right through the wrong reasons. The explanation of ""Canon Events"" was one of the most inventive story beats I've seen in any comic book movie, creating a much more solid explanation for the film's multiverse shenanigans than previous Marvel films such as ""Multiverse of Madness"" and ""No Way Home"". The fan service of seeing characters like Spectacular,1960s, and Insomniac Spider-Man, as well tie-ins to Spider-Man media ranging from the '70s comics to the MCU and Venom movies was amazing.Cons: The Spot has a lot of potential as the main villain and works great as a plot device to begin the movie's conflict, but his transition from a goofy villain in the first battle to a multiversal threat by the end doesn't seem convincing to me. He should've either been more serious at the ATM robbery or be more of a clueless character whose threat comes from his pick of understanding of his power. As it is, his threats to take everything Miles lives away from him feel empty. I also feel that Miguel deserved far more exploration instead of amounting to merely a secondary antagonist. His story, design, and fight scenes were by the far the best parts of the movie, and Oscar Isaacs delivers a standout performance in his voicework. In the end, despite an almost 2.5 hour runtime, 2099 felt more like an afterthought full of wasted potential. The threads of an interesting story were planted with the mentions by other Spider-People that Miguel was different, on account of his more serious personality and very different origin. Him projecting that resentment of being different onto hunting Miles, another ""different"" Spider-Man who wasn't even meant to exist would've been a great parallel that wasn't explored to its fullest. Finally, I have to address both Jessica Drew and Peter B. Parker. I thought both were well done, but I have to question the decision to make Jessica be fighting while pregnant and have PBP bring his toddler to dangerous situations. Both these things seem to go against Spider-Man's basic desire to protect the innocent. This problem also rears it's head in regards to how all the spiders from across the multiverse agree to Miguel's plan. You're telling me MCU Peter Parker won't let Dr. Strange send villains fated to die back to their home reality, but thousands of other spider people are willing to let each others' family and friends die for the good of the universe. I personally feel that's a bit of character assassination, especially for the spiders shown that we already know and love, such as Spectacular, Insomniac, Peter B, etc.To sum up, AtSV is a feast for the eyes visually, with some absolutely fantastic elements that I feel are slightly overshadowed by some issues I couldn't ignore. However, I'd still recommend a trip to the theater to experience the visual beauty of this film.",positive
506,"It ain't a bad film, but as a not so big Spider-Man fan the movie isn't as exciting as if you were a real hardcore fan. Personally the first one is a bit better, the second is still a good movie. It finds a good balance between comedy and drama, but sometimes it's a bit too much comedy. The plot twist is ok, but I didn't really find interesting.What I can is the movie is very well animated.It's a VERY overrated film and it personally didn't ""hype me up"" for the third movie of the trilogy.I hope that gives you a good enough understand of what you are going into if you ain't a Spider-Man fan. üëç",neutral
507,"The first impression of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is that the cinematography is visually stunning. The artwork and animations of the characters and backgrounds are pleasing to watch. Kudos to the artist team who put the hard work in. I loved how we saw almost and if not every Spider-Person from all the universes. My personal favorite was Spider-Punk being played by Daniel Kaluuya because he is a punk-rock character, but also still chill and nonchalant at the same time. It was glad seeing Miles Morales (Shamiek Moore) back in action as his and also Spider-Gwen's (Hailee Steinfield) stories dissolve all into one movie. It was nice to see that we have strong antagonists being played by Spot (Jason Schwartzman) and Spider-Man 2099/ Miguel O' Hara (Oscar Isaac). Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is great with its voice acting, cinematography, and the story. I would recommend watching it in theaters because I am going for a second viewing!",positive
508,"I went out to the theaters to see Spider Man into the spider verse too. And there's one thing I didn't know about it that perhaps if I had known about it in the beginning, I would have been able to judge it less harshly and enjoy it more. Spider verse two is part two of what they now are going to call the spider verse trilogy. That is to say it's a lot more like Empire Strikes Back is the first part of a two part movie. So I really don't know that I can review it that well, or say too much about it and the plot and the story, but when I can say is the into the spider verse to like spider verse one is incredibly beautiful. Each of the world has their own graphic art style, which is lovingly applied by the animators reminding us that there can be movies in more than just generic Disney Animation, or generic Pixar Animation, that there are many options when it comes to animation and they're all about the same price. Although some of these do use expensive computer animation to make it look like paper or our oil painting, or animated pencil animation. The film is full of fun references to other Spider Man films, Spider Man comic strips and even internet Spider Man rumors about Donald Glover becoming Miles Morales. The plot hums along and it's slowly develops who the main villain would be. At first it's hard to tell. It also develops the relationship between Spider Gwen and the main character. Not my littles blouse, the other Spider Man. Anyway, there's a lot of spider man and there's a lot of spider man in this film. I wish there would have been more spider pig and his excellent humor. I'm curious to see where the series goes in the third installment, which I assume will unite perfectly with the second film like Empire with Return of the Jedi. And at that time, perhaps I'll be able to better understand if it was great or not. But yes, it makes a big difference knowing that it's part two of three and that there will be no ending giant cliffhanger. Until next timeTranscribed by Otter.",positive
509,"There was literally no story. This movie is very much overrated. The visuals are too bright and you can't even see things clearly. Animations are cool but it doesn't even matter because the characters are just fighting for no reason. One of the most glaring issues with this movie is its lack of a compelling and well-developed storyline. From start to finish, it feels as if the plot is absent, leaving the viewer perplexed and disconnected from the events on the screen. The narrative fails to provide a clear direction or purpose for the characters, resulting in a disjointed and confusing experience. There were a few funny moments and that's all there is to it. Soundtracks were pretty mid. One of the worst movies I've watched, what a disappointment. 1/10.",negative
510,"The movie does a great job catching the audience up with Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. While we catch up to what's going on in their lives presently, we are also reminded of the events that took place in the previous film thus connecting both stories into one.Miles is the only Spider-man in his world and is dealing with that inner conflict. At the same time the film shows that Gwen Stacy is dealing with similar feelings. The characters are parallel to one another and even their family dynamics are similar as they deal with the issue of revealing to their families their true identity. This further adds to the idea of the spider-verse and how similar characters are dealing with similar issues although they are still unique.Gwen Stacy's backstory is explained in detail setting up some emotional moments between her and her father making this film feel grounded and relatable. Not only is it emotional but it also sets up perfectly her reason for joining the other Spider-men.Meanwhile Miles's story is used to introduce the new villain ""Spot"". The buildup to this character was very cool because it made the audience view him exactly how Miles Morales did while the movie was taking place. Spot initially felt like a dumb villain but then he turned into a serious threat and the build up to it was perfect.Miguel O'Hara was another cool character introduced in this film and I liked how his story and intentions were used to further explain how the Spider-verse works. He also added to the drama of the story and provided some intense moments throughout the film.There were so many cool cameos but it was done in a unique way that flowed with the story and not for the sake of including it. There are too many variations of Spider-man to mention but they were all very cool, it was a treat every time a different one was on screen. Also, all of the parents in this film felt organic and true to how parents would deal with the situations that were taking place.This film brought back the comic book style from the last film but it added upon it. When the story was taking place in Gwen Stacy's world the animation style was different than in Miles Morales' world and that attention to detail doesn't go unnoticed. This film gushes with style and blossoms with colors. It's just visually stunning all around. The character designs were just pure art especially with characters like Spider-punk and Spider-man India. The voice acting was amazing. All of the voices suited the characters and never felt out of place.This movie had a lot more heart and drama than the first film with an even better story. The conflict in this story is truly gripping and is intensified with each scene. It is all explained in great detail without being complex or convoluted. This movie was also funnier than the last one but it was never forced or took away from what was going on.This movie is entertaining from beginning to end. It will leave you wanting more by the time it ends. This is easily the best film of the year thus far without comparison. It did everything the first film did but better. This was truly a perfect movie.",positive
511,"Before I begin my review, WARNING! This is the first of a two-part movie. I don't mind two-parters, but I do resent finding out at the end.That said, when we begin this movie, we discover Miles Morales down in the dumps. True, he has just saved the multiverse, but he's a lonely neighborhood Spiderman, with his fellow spidermen (and women) off in their own versions of the Earth. However, when a villain called the Spot shows up, proclaiming himself Spiderman's nemesis, taking umbrage at being called the villain of the week, and Gwen Stacey's Spiderwoman shows up, Miles finds himself tagging along to discover a multiverse of Spidermen, Spiderwoman, Spidercats, Spiderbabies, and even a Spider Tyrannosaurus Rex, banded together to defend all reality.... and he's not welcome.Once again there are clever gags, every universe is drawn in a different style, and there is a clear metaphorical meaning to this: events may compel us into certain paths, making us seem no more than an expression of a trope, but who we are makes a difference in the outcome, too. The visual splendor of this movie makes it one you should see, if you are interested, in the theater. Even though I am annoyed at having a two-parter slipped past me without warning.",neutral
512,"The spiderverse movies truly are not only some of the best superheroes and animated movies, but simply some of the best movies of all time. They are such a spectacle to behold, pushing the boundaries of animation with every frame, but never forgetting to provide an engaging story with so much depth and heart to every character.Across the spiderverse is bigger and bolder than the previous entry. There is so much fan service and so much happening at once it can be hard to keep track of it on a first viewing. It wasn't until a second viewing that I began to appreciate and respect the care and love that went into every scene of this movie. It had an unpredictable story and ended in a way that will make you wish beyond the spiderverse was here right now. These movies are modern masterpieces and we are lucky to be able to witness them spectacularly unfold.",positive
513,"For the most part SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE maintains the high-quality of its predecessor while offering plenty of new experiences. The animation is beautiful and eye-popping. The story features plenty of action, some humor, and much heart. Some of the goodwill this excellent film inspires in its audience is squandered by the words ""To Be Continued."" After spending almost two and a half hours building up a complex story and concern for its characters, this film provides no resolution to any of its plot elements, making the end of the film disappointing and frustrating.Miles Morales returns for the next chapter of the Oscar¬Æ-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.",positive
514,"Spider-Man : Across The Spiderverse is a magnum opus when it comes to the world of animation.This movie achieves the impossible by exceeding its predecessor in literally every department - storytelling, character development, emotional beats, action choreography, sense of stakes, comedy, visuals, yes the visuals.Any amount of praise for the animation team wouldn't be enough as they have achieved a milestone in the history of animation with this. I am just gonna say this, when this movie releases on Digital and Blu-Ray, the wallpaper market will be booming.In a time where Marvel has been hit or miss recently, as it crumbles upon expectations built by its own, this movie reminded me what Marvel is capable of when they focus on telling a ""character's story"" rather than a ""franchise's story"".This is genuinely one of the best animated movies I have ever seen in my life, it is a ""perfect"" Spiderman movie in every sense of that word, and I will confidently go as far as to say that this is also one of the best superhero movies ever made, yes it deserves that pedestal.Do it justice and experience it on the big screen.",positive
515,"Across the Spider-Verse, the highly anticipated sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, falls far short of its predecessor and disappoints on multiple levels. From its poorly executed plot to its lackluster character development, this film proves to be an unfortunate misstep in the Spider-Verse franchise.One of the most glaring issues with Across the Spider-Verse is its convoluted and disjointed storyline. Rather than building upon the engaging narrative of the first film, this sequel attempts to introduce too many new elements and ends up feeling haphazard and confusing. The plot lacks focus, making it difficult for the audience to invest in the events unfolding on screen. It seems as though the writers were more interested in delivering flashy visuals rather than a coherent and engaging story.Additionally, the character development in Across the Spider-Verse is severely lacking. The film introduces numerous alternate versions of Spider-Man, but fails to give them sufficient depth or meaningful arcs. These characters feel like mere caricatures, existing solely to fulfill their assigned roles without any genuine growth or emotional resonance. This lack of depth undermines the film's ability to create a strong connection between the audience and its characters, leaving viewers disinterested and detached.Furthermore, the dialogue in Across the Spider-Verse is riddled with uninspired writing and cringe-worthy one-liners. The attempts at humor often fall flat, relying on tired clich√©s and juvenile gags that do little to engage or entertain. It feels as though the script was hastily put together, with little thought given to crafting compelling dialogue that could elevate the film beyond its visual spectacle.Visually, Across the Spider-Verse does offer some impressive animation, but it ultimately feels like a mere distraction from its glaring narrative flaws. While the vibrant colors and stylized visuals are visually striking, they cannot compensate for the film's lack of substance. The overreliance on flashy visuals only serves to further highlight the weak writing and poor storytelling at its core.In conclusion, Across the Spider-Verse is a prime example of a poorly written and misguided sequel. Its convoluted plot, shallow character development, and lackluster dialogue make for a frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience. Fans of the original film will be left feeling let down by this disappointing installment. It is a stark reminder that even the most visually stunning animation cannot save a film that lacks substance and coherent storytelling.",negative
516,"Rating: 6/10Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a highly anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking animated film that captured the hearts of audiences worldwide. While it continues to push boundaries in terms of animation, this installment falls short of reaching the same heights as its predecessor, resulting in a flawed masterpiece.Let's start with the positive aspects of the film. The animation in Across the Spider-Verse is simply stunning. The visual style is vibrant and dynamic, transporting viewers into a mesmerizing comic book world that bursts with life. The attention to detail, from the character designs to the action sequences, is truly commendable. The animation team deserves applause for their incredible work, as it remains one of the film's standout features.However, where the film falters is in its execution of the story and character development. The plot feels disjointed and lacks the cohesiveness of the first film. It introduces new characters and concepts without fully exploring them, leaving the audience wanting more. The pacing also feels uneven at times, making it difficult to fully invest in the narrative.Another letdown is the character development, which pales in comparison to its predecessor. While some characters receive satisfying arcs, others are given limited screen time or lack meaningful development altogether. It feels like missed opportunities to delve deeper into the complex web of emotions and relationships that the Spider-Verse universe offers.Furthermore, the film relies heavily on nostalgia and references to the original Spider-Verse, which can be both a strength and a weakness. While it provides a sense of familiarity and nostalgia for fans, it also prevents the sequel from standing on its own. At times, it feels like an echo of the first film rather than a fresh take on the Spider-Verse concept.Despite these flaws, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is still a visual spectacle that pushes the boundaries of animation. Its flaws may hinder its overall impact, but the moments of brilliance shine through. Fans of the original film will likely find enjoyment in revisiting this universe, albeit with tempered expectations.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse earns a 6/10 rating. It falls short of its predecessor's success due to its flawed execution of the story and character development. However, the film's stunning animation and visual style remain its saving grace, making it a worthwhile watch for fans of the Spider-Verse universe.",positive
517,"Up front: I can see how the animation style might turn off some people. Not many, but some. Also, it is ""continued Next Movie"", much as ""Infinity War"".Given those two as a codicil, this movie ranks as one of the best animated movies ever done. I currently rank things as The Incredibles (#1), Big Hero 6(#2) and Inside Out (#3). This one might take either #1 or #2, it'll depend on re-watchings, and the conclusion movie... Probably #2 -- at worst it's tied with BH6.The reason for the rating is pretty simple -- it's very strong on characterization, giving much more focus on Gwen and her relationship with her father, as well as Miles and his with his family. It does also develop some other characters further (spoilers would be required for more information, so no more comment there) and has quite a bit of fun to add to it. In addition, Miles becomes much less of a whiny insecure type, and more of a true ""Spiderman"".It also provides considerable development of the ""Spideyverse"" concept (for this movie series, at least), and may define its own version of that in the end -- that's part of the ""continued next movie"" aspect of it.In general -- strongly recommended, and I suspect it's worth more than a single re-watch, as well.",neutral
518,"Awesome animation, but just a bit too long and the cliff hanger ending was a punch in the gut. Our whole theater groaned when it ended. They could have cut some of the dragging parts toward the end and fit it in one longer movie. Or, kept it as two shorter movies, also fine. But the pacing was just really off, it started fast paced and the last like 30 minutes were just too slow.The art style is so cool though. I found myself just thinking how awesome it is to have such a unique film be so popular. It's like they grabbed a ton of great artists and said draw what you want, as long as you can make it Spider-Man related! Definitely see it, but maybe wait until you can watch both parts back to back!",positive
519,"I'm with Miguel, he's not supposed to become Spider-Man.His creator, Michael Bendis undermined Stan Lee by making an OP Spidey. He copied the real Scarlet Spider's invisibility and Earth 616 Spider Woman's venom blast. He's an aberration and yes, an anomaly. The disrespect!The question here remains, WHY is this movie about him? He is redundant! A cheap knock off! Also, probably the only wallcrawler who cannot make his own web-shooter and fluids. Guess Bendis forgot to make him a science whiz.The comics version of Spider-Verse is way better that this movie and they did not revolve around Miles! Plus the enemy there isn't a C-lister.",neutral
520,"Now this is the real deal version of Multiverse of Madness
SPOILERS AHEAD!!!As Miles and Gwen continue with their lives after the events of the previous film, Gwen came across a variant of Vulture and later with Spider man 2099. This opened up the entire multiverse showing different versions of Spider man across different earths. It even showed Ben Riley, Pavitr Prabhakar, Spider Punk, even the versions of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire showed up (though they just reused clips from previous films) and more Spider men from comics and animated versions.This film was a wild ride as it takes the viewers to what being a Spider man truly is. One can argue that this could be the BEST Spider man film to date while others still prefer No Way Home as the BEST. Regardless, this film is one of the BEST, a top tier CBM to date. It has the laughs, the action, the story, the romance (between Miles and Gwen), the pace, the music, the art/illustrations and so on. A very good comic book adaptation. This also joins the list of movies with ""better"" sequels like Spider man 2, Days of Future Past, The Winter Soldier, The Empire Strikes Back and so on.Worth watching in the cinema though the colors may make you feel nauseous if you are not in for it. Spider Man Across the Spider-Verse is a gem, definitely a movie made for very Spider man fan and every comic book fan.

521,"Synopsis: He is now grown up, more mature, and lived with the Spider Man curse for a year. He seems like he is enjoying it, until it gets really dark. Miles Morals returns once again but this time, it's a more powerful enemy that forces Miles to revisit the past and discover the dark and unhidden secrets of the future. He is now in a different ""spot"".Spider Man Across the Spider-Verse created a whole new Spider man experience for every fan. That's with the help of the visuals, using a more unique animation vibe that sets you up with the mood of the film, more characters, and most importantly, the story that has a very deep meaning behind it.Comparing to the animation style used in the first part that sent animation films into another different level, this time the film discovers new and more advanced techniques to set up the perfect mode and tone for the story.The first film dived in Miles Morales' deep character development with the different changes that he went throughout the whole film. As he becomes Spider Man, we see how he goes through all of those changes and how he will adapt to them. As he discovered more about the harshness of being a superhero and the sacrifices he has to make. However, in this film, Miles' character development gets even more tough especially that it sets it up for the third part as well. Miles is not a kid anymore, and the sacrifices he had to make in the first part, are nothing in compare to the ones in the second part. Voice actor Shameik Moore has a huge part in making all of this possible. By just voicing the character, you can feel the anger, fright, or even the sadness and happiness of the character.Speaking of voice actors, Hailee Steinfeld proves herself again as a solid voice actor for Gwen Stacy. Especially that this film focuses more on that character on a deeper level and her relationship with her dad or with her past traumatic experiences. All of that can be seen in the great opening sequence of the film that is in my opinion, the best Spider Man opening sequences and can be considered to be one of the best opening sequences of a super hero film, of course after The Dark Knight's (2008) opening sequence. Daniel Pemberton's music and the animation colors with it's connection to Gwen Stacy and the many easter eggs that have a deeper meaning behind them.Composer Daniel Pemberton has a music piece titled ""Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)"" in the film that can be heard in the opening sequence specifically in which you can clearly tell that it is expressing Gwen's feelings. Especially that it came up in a scene that included a conversation with her dad in a room and the animation & colors on the walls of the room are inspired by water colors and they were dripping down like whenever the conversation between the daughter and the father gets tense or heated. Small details like this are the reason of making this film the greatest animation film SO FAR and the greatest film to tell a Spider Man story.My rating is 9.5/10Watched on June 2nd, 2023

The character development is incredible, with Gwen's story being the easy standout for me. The movie's fairly long and it doesn't waste a single minute. It could've been five hours long and I wouldn't have complained. It will obviously leave you wanting even more.The animation is mind-blowing. As gorgeous as you'd expect from a sequel to Into The Spider-verse.I don't know how they did it, but they did it. Again. What an incredible movie.",negative
524,"I had a chance to watch this in IMAX/Dolby, chose not to. I regret that decision now. If you're like me and haven't watched it yet, please go to the theater and don't get a digital rent/wait for streaming.Getting back, this has easily shot up to the top of my list of movies I enjoyed this year, by far the favorite. I'm probably late with this so I'll keep it short.Visuals - STUNNING! I haven't seen these many colors in an English film before.Animation and Editing - EPIC! I have no idea how much effort went into making the Paramount Pictures/Sony logo and editing it to get the glitch effect, let alone the entire film. *slow claps*
Music and Sound Design - AMAZING! The OST and the way it's been used throughout the film - I'd watch it again for this and the visuals alone.Writing - AWESOME! It's not easy write for a film, I can't begin to think how tough it would have been to write something to bring everybody in and make a Spider-society without making it feel choppy. And I am not even going to attempt to comment on the writing for the storyline.A cinematic experience like nothing else - don't miss this in big screens. You can always re-watch on digital/streaming.",positive
525,"Miles Morales gets into the Spiderverse again. The stakes are higher, the emotions are stronger, and life is harder - things we all identify with.While this movie was highly anticipated, I feared it would be over hyped. Into the Spiderverse seemed perfect - a fantastic standalone movie that a sequel has the potential to ruin. BUT, Across the Spiderverse does it. It masterfully continues where the original picked up, connecting lose ends, and expanding the franchise seemlessly. Somehow, this film grounds the multiverse trope with its focus on human emotion, themes of loss, finding your purpose, and coming of age. Miles and Gwen are characters I really shouldn't identify with, but I do. Their stories and feelings are compelling, and what make this soon to be trilogy so special.Go watch it. Though it may be too intense for some littles, this movie (and the first one) are must-see.",positive
526,"I was a Biiiiiiig Into the Spider Verse fan. Hearing that the sequel has gone berserk in comments, I couldn't help but follow the hype, and expecting a sequel that finally follows the quality of the first film. But after seeing it in cinema, I gotta say that it does fall a little far from the tree, but still satisfactory though.I'm kinda a classics movie fan, I'm not really used to all the electric style musics, the fansy kaleidoscopic cinematography. The first film Into the Spider verse was just the right amount for me: a steady push of story pace, the right amount of character lines and visual effects, a clear coming of age Spider man classic story telling, and really astounding soundtrack. It was in my heart the best spider man movie ever.Across the spider verse is a very ambitious sequel, you can easily tell that producers have put in gargantuan amount of work, and they wish to exceed the success from the first. However, as a non comic fan, I got 50% lost during the first half of the movie: so many little jokes, so many lines, some are clear, some got covered by score, and all of them are small talks that just force you to laugh, which I don't like. The first films amount of talk was just the right amount, because in real life people don't banter and make jokes for everything and at any time! E.g. Uncle Aaron portrays a caring, swag uncle in just one scene where he taught the ""shoulder touch"" to Miles, and he went to graffiti with Miles. See? You don't need to talk sassy jokes nonstop, and you literally can't force audience to like a character. It goes for Miles parents, Gwen, the Indian spider man, and Peter B Parker. So many lovable characters from film 1 just become unprofound storytelling gimmicks, where were the life of them like in the first film? Where were the iconic moments like Pere Parker telling Miles ""You can't know when you're ready, it's a leap of faith""? Or like Miles leaping off of building in slow motion, with ""What's up danger"" playing in the back? Seriously, the gravity of pace is gone, the swag is gone, the liveness of characters is gone.The movie gets better in the second part, where it became a thriller/mystery movie, you can feel that the story telling is getting the hang of it. See? Slower, be more patient, and take some gravity into the story telling would be so much better. I kinda lost it when Gwen puts up a team of force to rescue Miles, and when Miles meets Earth 42 himself as Prowler. The scenes get longer, music fits better, and the hype is built up for Beyond the Spider Verse. But honestly the first half was a typical Hollywood talk show that does little to character arcs, and inevitably can't make itself exceed the first film. I wish the film could be edited to cut out the talks, keep only the core contents. The thriller/mystery plot is an excellent take, go bigger in Beyond the Spider Verse, and please impress me.",positive
527,"I felt a bit lost watching this fast-paced movie with great animation, as some of the odd animation made me dizzy. The first half mainly focuses on Gwen and her encounter with Spider-man 2099. Although I may have missed the tragedy in her universe, the movie expands the Spiderverse and introduces The Spot as a new villain, shedding new light on Miles Morales as the new Spider-man. The scene to keep an eye out for is when Miles is bitten by the spider, leading to a shocking conclusion that will permanently alter him. Overall, this film is a continuation, and I'm excited for the next installment.",positive
528,"A much more commercial feel than the first and ultimately just the first half of an overly long movie.It's well done and the art is good, though not as inspired as the first outing, but I left the theatre feeling hollow and frustrated that they chose to end on a cliffhanger that really just felt like the halfway point of what should have been the plot of a single movie.The main protagonist was established early and then basically forgotten about and a secondary kinda not great protagonist was established and dealt with instead as essentially the true protagonist of this movie.I dunno, overall it was good but the choice to make the movie try to force you to come back and watch the final part when it comes out is frankly insulting. Just make a good movie and we'll come back much like we did already for this... can't say I'm excited for the follow up.",positive
529,"The plot is so bad that it overshadows the otherwise good action. This unbearable morality with the naive attempt to save the other universes and risk everything is hard to bear. It just makes the movie unbearable, it would be really nice if the characters had some credibility and their decisions weren't completely stupid. The idea of the multiverse is otherwise quite good, if they had put a little more budget into the plot, it could have been a good movie.Acting is quite good as usual so it's a pity having these great actors having to stick to such an abmysal plot. Watch if you can see past it.",positive
530,"I have to say it's a really good movie and a really good ending, so I was conflicting between rating it an 8 or a 9 so in my mind it's an 8.9. I think what really made the movie more enjoyable and a little bit of interesting is 1. The animation is a little bit different from into the spider verse and showing all of the different universes in different kinds of animation And I love how they showed that. 2. The scene with Miguel showing miles what happened to all of the Spider-Man's loved ones dying and him messing up and that whole chase scene was really fantastic. I really think the whole ending part with miles accidentally going to the wrong universe and that universe miles being the prowler and Gwen having to look for miles and ready for the stuff she's going to go through. I think the next movie is going to be better than both movies.",positive
531,Awesome sauce. Ya I did not see the pic I was just saying lol I guess it's just not a big thing lol I guess I don't have a big deal I don't like that I just got the money lol I just thought I'd ask if I was a big guy but I'm just not really good lol I guess I don't want it lol I guess it's cool I guess I just thought I'd let ya you gonna lol lol oh sorry lol lol sorry for not being able lol I love ya lol I guess I just thought I would have to be there for you lol I just thought I was going on the same page I was like what do I need lol I love ya you don't know how much you hate it but it's like I.,positive
532,"I've just seen the movie once. My heart kept racing an hour later.All Spider-man art has always been a field of experimentation, impossible poses, unexpected angles and framing. It gave the artist extra freedom to use their creativity in bold ways.Bold is the word I'd use to describe best this movie. As with all art, some people are going to love it, many are going to hate it and it won't speak at all to some. It speaks to my 16 year old self in ways I can't describe (I'm 45 now). It made me feel like getting a new comic book, like making music and painting and spraying the city.I can't talk about the plot, the voice-acting, the characters... Because I'm mesmerized by the art. The actual art of every frame, yes, but also the presentation of that in motion, with the selection of music, and the jorney that the movie takes us on, with the emotions that are present in each scenne.I wouldn't probably go to an exibition of art about Spider-man, but I felt I did just that, and it blew my mind. So urban, so comic-y, so fresh...So many styles combined in a masterful way so that even the real world doesn't seem out of place when it's shown.If you are into street art, I think it would blow your mind too. And yeah, it also comes with movie (gotta watch it again and pay attention to the plot).",positive
533,"This is probably the best spiderman movie ever id watch it over and over again. The characters are insane kids and adults would enjoy this They made Miles so cool the storyline is very catchy as well, I don't want to say too much because im going to end up spoiling just go and watch it with family and friends and enjoy. I don't know hoe I never can across Miles Morales comics its crazy cause I been a Marvel fan since I was a kid and I read most of the comics but oh well. I just hope this doesn't end here he needs to meet the Avengers and they need to make a real movie of him that will be sick.",positive
534,"That movie was a big hype everyone has known of that movie komin but I didn't think it was that good as the hype has added in the past 3 weeks,.. for sure the into the Spider-verse was way better the characters and the animation and basically the story too, I personally loved it, it has everything above the 10 rating-and it didn't even have that much hype as the atsv but yk business is business quarter of the money came from that ads and others, btw I'll give a rating to the Across the Spider-verse as a 10 bc it was not that bad BUT not good at all, but Sony deserve it and the Spiderman creaturesüíôüëçHope y'all enjoyed my rewiew! Tt: alphyeditz.",positive
535,"It's no joke that into the spider-verse was a big step for Spider-Man and Sony pictures animation's style on animation. And yet it's sequel is an even bigger step for Spider-Man connecting even more spider-men into the main stream media. There is even an MCU reference in the begging of the movie and the trailers where Miguel O'Hara aka Spider-Man 2099 (voiced by Oscar Isaac) saying ""don't even get me started on ""Doctor Strange"" and that little nerd back on earth 199999"". It is implied that the MCU is word 199999, even though the Spider-Man movie that was referenced was No Way Home, and that movie said that the MCU was earth 616. But no it's not, that is the main stream for comics this movie implies that 616 is the comic universe, and the MCU is earth 199999. Which means that he entered the MCU to fix some problems involving spider man's from different universe's. I actually loved the ending where there's a cliffhanger that I won't spoil and an animator said that the sequel beyond the spider verse might be delayed because of overwhelming work schedule. But I honestly can't wait for Sony to expand the spider-verse.",positive
536,"Not a bad movie, at all. Well made and very thought-provoking in a child-friendly language and format. But, it is so ridiculously long. Typical action ""epic saga"" from Marvel of this day and age (yes, I'm over 40), the action sequences and some of the transitions are unnecessarily long. Just padding, add absolutely nothing to the story. Took my two young boys to the see this, they thoroughly enjoyed it. I took a very nice power nap (or two) and still didn't miss anything. This version is also focused on the more ""realistic"" and ""human"" universe, one of the things I most enjoyed from the previous one is the diversity of universes, and spending some time in each of them.",neutral
537,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a spectacular and thrilling sequel to the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The film continues the adventures of Miles Morales, who reunites with Gwen Stacy and meets a new team of Spider-People from different dimensions. The film is a visual feast, with stunning animation that blends different styles and techniques to create a unique and immersive experience. The film is also a heartfelt and humorous story, with great voice performances by Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac, Jake Johnson, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, and more. The film explores themes of identity, friendship, responsibility, and heroism, while also delivering exhilarating action sequences and clever references to the Spider-Man lore. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-see for fans of Spider-Man and animation, and a worthy addition to the Spider-Verse saga.",positive
538,"There is potential for a great story here and on top of that some incredible animation, that at some points does fall flat (will come back to that later). The movie isn't as bad as the average movie/show that big studios put out and have been putting out for the past few years. But it still suffers from the same issues.So the movie starts off with Gwen, and eventhough I actually like the character it almost made me turn off the movie. Because I was convinced that they had turned the Miles Morales movie into the Gweneverse movie instead. All other movies and shows releasing in the past few years have conditioned me to just assume that a female / young girl side character will become the main focus over the protagonist. It starts off with an animation style that really reminded me of AI created art. We have a very edgy Gwen and her band mates, who are all, the by now super tropey short, blue haired, body positive types. In her universe Peter Parker is a screwup loser, he's not spiderman he's just a wannabe that turns into a villain and then dies. Which is sort of a theme in the movie, Peter Parker is constantly done dirty. Sony also did this in the new game, where Peter Parker suddenly acts like he's the insecure new guy and Miles is ""a much better spiderman"". The same thing happens in this movie.Anyway, after we see how much of a loser Peter is in Gwen's universe. We get introduced to the vampire spidey, who is pretty cool. But apparently he can't handle a mid tier villain, not even with the help of Gwen. So he calls for backup. And we get introduced to the most annoying, most ridiculous character in this movie. A pregnant black lady on a motercycle... that's also a spiderma-woman. Let me reitterate .. a pregnant lady... on a motorcycle with a giant afro. And Gwen acts like this lady is the ""coolest"" person she's ever seen. I don't even know where to start with how dumb it is. On top of that she somehow stays pregnant the entire movie despite the fact she's highly pregnant at the start and by the end months have passed. Shortly after we get an ACAB moment when Gwens dad finds out she's a spidey.Then we finally go back to Miles and the animation style turns back into the brilliant style of the previous movie.The story is pretty decent. The acting / voice acting is really good and the animation for the most part is incredible.But in this movie Peter Parker is an effeminate comic relief dad who takes his new spider daughter everywhere. We get introduced to a thousand different spidermans and a large part of them are ""body positive"" spiderthems. The movie focuses a lot on ""how cool"" the pregnant biker spider-woman is. We get a wheelchair spider. Every single ""ESG"" checkmark thing you can imagine, it's in here. But I do have to say, other than the pregnant spider, most of it doesn't pander too much. It's just there in the background, it's constantly there. And if you're kinda sick and tired of this new trend like I am. Then it will annoy the hell out of you.They do the same thing as in the game. Miles Morales is a better spiderman than Peter Parker. You know the thing from Rick and Morty? ""The Rickest, Rick""? Miles is basically the spiderest, spidey. In fact every spiderman from every universe tries to stop him at one point, and not a single one of them succeeds. He's just ""that good"". While this happens Peter Parker tells him how he had a child because of Miles. He thought Miles was soo cool.. so incredible, and so special. He had a child hoping the child would be like Miles. Not even special forcefields can stop Miles. Only one that can take Miles out is evil miles .. with a single punch and then he holds him captive, by tying him up with some wires.Miles can do it all. He's a brilliant student without trying. He's the strongest, fastest, bestest spiderman and everyone loves him. Even the laws of the universe don't count when it comes to him. We're supposed to think it's really cool that he endangers all other universes and trillions, gazillions, a multiverse full of lifes to defy the laws of the multiverse. Every other spiderman had, had to make a sacrifice. Not Miles, ""he writes his own story"". They are trying so hard to make Miles ""the Spiderman"".And then on the end we get a ""to be continued"".. one of my biggest pet peeves ever. They could have given this movie a satisfying ending and still have left us wanting another movie or have some unresolved issue, instead we got a cliffhanger. Which made makesy ou feel like you've just watched a very long episode of some tv show.I don't get it.. we loved Miles. Why are they trying so hard to make us dislike the kid? By pushing this whole ""Miles is THE spiderman"" stuff and the they/them spiders. It's making the movies and character so unappealing. Sony had been relatively good with not jumping into the ESG bs. But now that there is more backlash from audiences than ever for this stuff, they've decided they are joining blackrock, vanguard, disney and the other soulless corpos.",positive
539,"I needed a strong coffee and a sweet after watching this and it was early evening.It lacks adventure and good times. The action was limited.This movie has a lot of drama, teen romance, and arguing. In the first part it's loud I get it, the bigger cities can be loud and families have drama things in it. I came to enjoy myself and forget about loud neighbors and problems, not be smacked in the face with it. There are background stories for a lot of characters, this takes away from fun times that Spiderman usually has in other movies. It can also be a coming of age piece for tweens and teens which is cute but after awhile I came for action and adventure not a crush piece and emotional stuff.It has good visual drawings and graphics. It reminds me of those really big illustrated books that I would get from the library when I see it.When I hear it, the dialogue and story, I'm like Huh? Boom! What happened? I thought this was Spiderman not a soap opera in cartoon form.",positive
540,"A masterpiece!This is nothing less than an act of extraordinary creative genius.Not only is it the best animation movie ever made, it is also one of the best movies ever made.This wonderfully engaging story follows deeply realised characters through action packed superhero adventure story. And while as much as it is a superb roller coaster superhero adventure it is also a wonderful story about relationships, family and love. And those relationships are touching, genuine and deep. Much of that is down to well formed and relatable characters and great dialogue.And while all that makes the film outstanding it is the film's mind-blowing creativity and stylistic animation that raises it to masterpiece status.It is a perfect example of art conveying feeling, meaning and substance. While watching it you constantly feel the urge to hit pause so you can admire the beauty and creativity and study the detail. And you know you could do it at any point randomly in the film because the beauty, creativity and detail is in every scene. But of course the story is way to engrossing to do that.Animation, colour and style is used throughout this film to create and emphasise feelings, plot points, characteristics, intentions, emotions, action etc in a way that adds enormous depth, nuance and meaning.As a result of the superb storytelling, wonderful characters and mind-blowing creativity it is a film that you experience as much as it is a film that engages and entertains.It is a film that will set new standards and direction in film making and studied, discussed and admired for decades.",positive
541,"Great character building and story telling combine with awesome art style. This movie is so good from the begining to the end, no sleepy moment for me.Personally I prefer Endgame because of the hype but this will easily be my 2nd best Marvel movie of all time. If you like Into the spiderverse, you will like this one 10 times.Only 1 thing to note is that this movie is quite confusing for non-fan. I went with a friend who are not really in Marvel movie but watched a bunch of them and he still got overwhelmed.Btw, 10/10 for me and my wife. Definitely recomend for other Marvel fan and we will watch it again when blu-ray come.",positive
542,"I want to be a part of the crowd that says they're done with superhero movies. There's a little superiority complex there. Although I believe superhero flicks are destroying the film industry, they are so dang fun. Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is unlike any superhero movie you will probably ever see. It's surely not your run of the mill. Perhaps films like this bring serious innovation to the big screen rather then destruction! I believe it so, as this film is unlike anything I've ever seen before.The animation is unreal, so creative and mind blowing that human being are even capable of creating this kind of 2D art! It's a seriously impressive film artistically speaking, and the brilliance doesn't end there.After watching the first spider verse film you would think they wrapped up a good thing, but they carry on this Miles Morales story in a really good way. This story is so fresh and exciting that it had 'e staring at the screen in disbelief (and sensory overload) with my jaw to the floor. So unbelievably fun and creative.See this film. Twice probably. Can't wait for #3.",positive
543,This movie totally justifies the delayed release. Every frame is a work of art I'd put up on my wall. Massive props to all the creative minds that worked on this beautiful project. The world building is incredible and the acting is heartfelt. Daniel Pemberton has done a phenomenal job on the background score. I'm excited to see all the cameos listed here very soon.It would be a crime to miss out on this movie. An absolute love letter to Spider-Man fans. I'm excited to see what the next part has in store for us. Definitely need more animated movies like this one. Amazing. Sensational. Spectacular.,positive

I rarely give anything a 10 especially a cartoon but I really hope this film get nominated as I was pure joy to watch.

546,"Am I the only one who finds Miles Morales to be a little punk-brat that needs a good slapping? He's so annoying and disrespectful and up himself that I just can't root for him so that really brings my enjoyment of the movie (and my score) down. He's just not likeable at all.I watched the first movie the night before going to see this and actually enjoyed it more than I remembered. I remember not liking the style of the animation but it didn't bother me so much.The animation in this movie is at times beautiful and jaw-dropping.I really like the Gwen Stacey Spider-Girl and I found myself really rooting for her.I thought the film dragged in places and either due to this or the fact that Perrin and I went to see it at 10.30pm I did find myself dropping off in a few places towards the end.I didn't like the cliff-hanger ending. I heard an interview with the makers of the movie and they said it wasn't a part one and part two and that this was a stand-alone film in it's own right. Nonsense. It's literally a cliff-hanger with a ""To be continued ..."" so I felt a bit cheated at that.73/100.",positive

That might sound weird to others but boy does this movie really deliver in the emotions. I love the whole dynamic miles has with his family and his struggles with being spider-man and his struggles in finding his own purpose is a really amazing character point this movie utilizes extremely well. This movie is simply a masterpiece in every sense the animation,pacing,voice acting and characters. I simply cannot do this movie justice with words all i can really say is it's a masterpiece.",positive
548,"It's a lot of kumbya and mommy daddy speeches. I couldn't stand it. In the 2002 Spider-Man movie, we get what 2-3 serious moments with Ben, May etc. And that was a live action. Don't know why a cartoon needs at least 5-6 of those moments eating up what 20-30 min of solid drama. I mean drama is important, it builds the emotion and makes the action stand out. But come on. I just saw little mermaid and I think I like that better. Because at least I knew what I was getting myself into, a cartoon romance. Watching this new spiderverse movie, didn't realize I signed up for digrasse high with a pinch of Spider-Man.",neutral

Metro Boomin' could not leave a mark as Post Malone's Sunflower but his score is still really good for the ears and I've kept both 'Am I Dreaming' and 'Hummingbird' on loop after the movie.I was so glad I did not wait till the digital version comes out, it is a crime not to watch this on a big screen. You really should watch it, if you still haven't. Also I am loving the fact that everyone went crazy for Spider-Man 2099 after the movie while his suit has been in almost every Spider-Man game and he even got his own.

553,"First of all, the film handles the multiverse theme very nicely and in search of answers to some philosophical questions, Miguel O-Hara is among my favorite characters in the film, I may have misspelled. Of course, there are places in the film that I don't like, for example, it seemed ridiculous to me that Miles Morale couldn't be caught by a bunch of Spiderman, and I couldn't warm up to the character of Gwen But apart from these, the other aspects of the film have shown that the effort has been spent on the film to the end, and I will wait until next year it ends with a very good ending for the next film.",positive
554,"Stunning. Artistically, emotionally, and visually captivating. From the intro to the ending, this movie spared nothing and gave everything.Whether you are a comic nerd or fresh to the spider-verse, this movie wraps you in it's webs. The story, pacing, characterization...everything is excellent. It's rare to have so many characters in a movie and be able to give each one sooooo much soul.And whether you are a kid, or have kids, this movie will absolutely resonate on so many levels. I'm a parent and saw this with my daughter, and really wasn't expecting to tear up multiple times when the realities of love and friendship were tested.This movie absolutely (and for a second time) captures the heart of the character that is Spider-Man. Showing that being Spider-Man is, and always has been as much a story about one hero as it is about the people around him that love, support, and test him. This movie is clear that being a superhero is about more than being a hero, it's about those you love, those you will fight for, no matter what.",positive
555,"The visuals, the animation, the style, the music. That's all a solid 10/10. Unfortunately this alone does not define a masterpiece... story telling as ironic as that sounds regarding ""Across the Spider-Verse"", is very important when crafting a newly beloved protagonist in the role of Spider-man.I would equate this lack of story as an attribute of all the ""multi-verse"" bridges to tell a story, essentially, if the writers want a character to be defined a certain way, they just take the ""multi-verse"" short cut and bam, they have you feeling sympathetic to someone. It's cheap, and over used despite being one of the first movies to apply ""multi-verses"" in the past few years to their story telling, the success of the first release clearly influenced other writers to take advantage of the same gimmick, just look at Marvel and DC right now.All in all, this is a fun movie with cool animations and a couple welcome twists.",positive
556,"Very nice to watch with friends or family. If you are a marvel fan, dont lost this one. Nice musics, history, characters and you dont particule need to know the context to understand. But, if dont want to lose nothing on the movie, I recommend you to watch the first one and search about the others (like the ps5 one). I always knew the movie was great, but not like that. It cleary a 10/10 movie in my opinion. I will probaly watch it again. The only thing that is ""bad"" on it, is the fact that it wasnt finish, needs a part 2. For some folks this is bad, but, in my opinion it aint that bad, it makes the history be more complex then the others, like if we was reading a comic. (Salve pro brasil)",neutral

The story was unreal, but I found that by the end, I had a headache, and my eyes were tensed. The story was impactful and generally fun to get into and that made me want to watch more even though my eyes felt like flaming hell. I know a few people said this to me when they watched it, and they'd mentioned that they felt like too much was happening at times. It is a fun watch at times with the story, but do be warned, your eyes probably will hurt by the end.",negative
558,"So slow, overly long and didn't resolve any of the plot points that were set out in the beginning of the movie.The art direction of this movie was the best part of this movie, and it was nice to see the different styles in each of the worlds.The character development is that of a typical angsty teen, becoming an adult, taking action without thinking of consequences, and thinking that they are the centre of the universe, which my be true in Miles's case, but the movie was so drawn out that it didn't feel like he grew enough over the span of the movie to justify it being 2 hours and 20 min, especially when nothing came to fruition.I feel they're trying to leave us on the edge like they did with Infinity War, but with none of the momentum or excitement.",positive
559,"Spider Verse 2 is by far in my opinion, the best movie of 2023. The screenplay is incredibly powerful and imaginative, the emotional weight and dialogue really sell it for me, it was like something out of Pixar's The Incredibles. The animation is by far the biggest highlight of the movie, so many art styles and colors were taking place all at once I couldn't stop seeing them in my head afterwards, probably the most beautiful looking animation I have ever seen, it was like a cross between Akira, The Incredibles and WALL-E. Spider Verse 2 is definitely the must see film of 2023, it is worth it. üï∏",positive
560,"This movie has the potential to be the best of the year. The animation in this film is something so fresh and unique it keeps your attention for the whole movie. The characters in this film are so fleshed out and you get really attached to them by the end. My favourite character in this film was Spider-Man 2099 he felt like a real threat to miles. The Spot is a great villain and is sort of like the Thanos of this franchise. The cliffhanger ending is ok, the movie kinda feels more like Gwen's then Miles. Also lots of great cameos the stand out being Lego Spider-Man, Insomniac Spider-Man and Donald Glover Prowler.",positive
561,"Across the Spiderverse is one of those sequels that builds upon all of the things it should build on and adds stakes in a way that feels organic thus making it just as good as it's predecessor if not even better at least in my eyes.Not only is this movie what I mentioned above but it is also quite possibly the greatest animated film to ever grace this world, no I am not joking. This movie is one of very VERY few that is able to mix such potent character writing, such masterful plot writing, breathtaking visuals, amazing acting and a stellar soundtrack all together.This movie has so much heart, so much heart and so much love put into it that you can feel it, you can feel the passion for storytelling, the passion for art. This movie embodies what art is all about.If you have not watched this movie go watch it NOW, it is genuinely one of the best that I have ever seen and probably the greatest animated movie of all time.",positive
562,"I saw it in 2D, and I didn't want to leave the theater because I enjoyed this movie so much. Spider Man Across the Spider Verse is better than the Spider Man into The Spider Verse and it might be one of the greatest sequels ever made. This film is the 1st part of the 2nd movie of The Spider Verse franchise and the movie will be continued in the 3rd movie titled Spider Man Beyond the Spider Verse which is supposed to hit in theaters in 2024. The animation in the film is so good and they had a lot of money for the film. I hope and I think that The Spider Verse will be one of the greatest Spider Man franchises ever!",positive
563,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is such a fantastic film for all ages! It is a cinematic achievement for an animated film and sets the bar so high. I would be very surprised if this film does not get nominated for the Best Picture category. The casting for the voice actors is spot on and the chemistry is so good. I won't spoil anything in this film but will say there are so many hidden Easter eggs that really made me smile big. You will know what I'm talking about when you watch it. I can't wait for the 3rd movie to come out! Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse gets a perfect 10 out of 10 from me. A perfect film! See it now!,positive
564,"Wow, wow, wow. Originally I was expecting this to be a really good movie after into the spider-verse but man it was even better than I could've ever imagined, it has everything you could want in a Spider-Man movie, heart, humour, great visuals, faithful to the comics, creative, exciting, drama. This was much much better than it's predecessor and that's saying something as that was amazing. I seriously recommend watching this movie if you haven't already and I would be lying if I hadn't had superhero fatigue from the mediocre movies we've been getting recently but man this was truly epic, and not only is this one of the best superhero movies ever but one of the best movies ever made (in my opinion).",positive
565,"Overall, across the spider verse is a good movie, but it has some major problems. Besides the fact that it is unceremoniously and brutally sliced in half, the movie often lacks focus and tempo between important plot points. Some parts of the movie felt downright unfinished. It doesn't top the original spider verse movie, and many scenes/events Depend on the next movie, both to prove that they were worthwhile, and to receive a payoff. Unfortunately, I don't believe all of these will get such a payoff, as I feel the movie stretched multiple sequences to extend it's runtime.I also severely dislike the villain and feel he was done poorly.That being said, some of the most beautiful scenes, both In a visual sense, and in an emotional sense are in those movie. Some of the best cinema I have ever seen takes place in this movie. There are so many great scenes, characters, and stories in this movie, I just wish it had all of those consistently.While the movie has many flaws, it has many good parts as well, and I would strongly recommend anyone and everyone to watch this movie, even if I don't think they would like it.",positive
566,"I never expected 'spider-man: into the spider-verse' to be this great. Slow burning, excellent sound, extremely mind bending plot.The sequel ""Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse"".. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic with amazing and creative multiverse content.Can't wait for the third installment. Every frame of this movie is great! One can watch this film over abd over and finds something new to enjoy every time. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that's make it a great sequel.",positive
567,"And that's the ting, as beautiful as it is, the story really stalls about mid-way through and I found myself looking at my watch because so much was left to be concluded because the story kept getting diverted. Lo and behold just when we start to see some progress again we are greeted with the old ""To be Continued "" and I would say a large percentage of the audience groaned with some verbal abuse thrown in. I would thoroughly recommend it but the audience needs to know in advance that it's a 2 parter. (I hope it's only a 2 parter!) It's a movie that definitely requires a rewatch though as it's bursting at the seams with detail and nuances that whizz by in the theatre. I want to wait until I can watch it at home and view it in slow motion. The artwork is beautiful and the action on steroids.",positive
568,"This movie was extremely slow, and I kept on wanting to look at my watch to see how much time had gone by, because the plot was moving forward so slowly.And at then end, in those two hours they only fit in half a movie. What a disappointment at the end to end with a simple to be continued.It's a real shame because there are so many great things in the movie - the humour is hilarious, the animation really is something special, the spider verse is really engaging. It's just so disappointing that the story/plot is where it falls short - it just really goes nowhere. In a few years when the sequel comes out I'll have completely forgotten what happens.",positive

570,"""Spiderverse 2"" begins with a promise; A bold, ambitious and scary promise. ""Let's start differently this time,"" Gwen Stacy tells us. So different"". It's as if the makers are clarifying their goal with this sequel from Gwen's words: ""If you expect this movie to be another safe and conventional sequel that backs away from pushing new boundaries, you'd be very wrong."" This promise is scary, because we are talking about a sequel whose first part was not only different, but thanks to its completely original, innovative and exceptional visual style that refused to conform to the dominant and common Hollywood animation form, it was a full-fledged revolutionary and groundbreaking film. Had A film that unleashed the untapped potential of the animation medium like opening Pandora's box, and the world was no longer the same after that, or could not be the same again.We are talking about a film that killed the conservative and boring visual style of Pixar, which has been known as the default form of Western animation for several decades. Throughout its career, Pixar has mastered a type of animation style that can be described as ""photo-surrealism"". Although Pixar's animations have a kind of exaggerated cartoon style (especially the design of the faces and bodies of the characters), most of the elements that make up the world of these films are synonymous with the real world; Pixar's detailed realism has increased with the advancement of technology: not only does Pixar now not overlook even the smallest fibers in Mr. Incredible's shirt, but it depicts the virtual world of its animations as if they were filmed with real physical cameras (for example, how to use the effect (Remember the bokeh or diopter split effect in Toy Story 4).",negative
571,"I think this movie is way better than the first one. I loved the new characters introduced, especially hobie brown, pavitr and spot. And I love the starting scene with Gwen. The story was very great and I love how it sets the scene for the third movie. It definitely ended with a cliffhanger. And the fact that there isn't even an end credits scene is just very exciting. I can't wait for the third movie. I can't even start on the animation!! It was just wonderful. I love all the effects and the style of the animation. I would say this is the best movie of 2023 so far in my opinion. I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone!!!",positive
572,"This is the most stunning, beautiful movie I've seen in ages, and the story is just so good. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen from the beginning and I had a ton of laughs. Everything was perfect, and interesting. The visuals, the story, the moral dilemmas, the complex characters and relationships. This movie was so much fun, even more so than the first. It just goes off with its' craziness, with both its story and art style.Just be aware there is a cliffhanger, this movie is only part 1. That was disappointing, but I still wouldn't change a thing - the movie is way too good to be cut down to make room for a full story.",positive
573,"This one certainly took some time to process, especially since it's not all said and done and there's a sequel in the works to make the theme more clearly with an ending.But I think I got it. The first movie's theme was about finding faith in yourself, I think this one is about being consistently faithful to what you know is right.All our main spider characters from last time are being told that doing the right thing and saving their loved ones from a death they know is coming is wrong and will cause reality to collapse. A microcosm of this is Gwen's small completed arc, which has her being told that she should give herself up to her father despite it meaning that she and the entire city will be punished for her good deeds. Instead, she persisted in doing the right thing, saving others and appealing to her father even when it seemed fruitless.Miguel is the true villain of this film, and represents the inverse. He has persisted in doing the wrong thing, whether that be deceiving his replacement theory or forcing others to allow people to die because ""the continuum"" (which will likely be revealed to be something about how he lost his replacement theory that Miguel misunderstood or didn't know or look for for a workaround). We will likely see in the future film how this was a mistake and will turn out poorly for Miguel and the people who he decided to protect. Dark Miles will no doubt be an extension of this.Current Miles' family situation is already an extension of these themes. He persists in doing the right thing (Spider-man duties), but it's derailing his family life. The reason is because he doesn't do the right thing consistently enough. He should be honest with his family, but his fear and fear of the presumably false dichotomy Miguel and Gwen present him with of it not turning out well prevents him from doing what he knows is right.A really good thematic framework but boy is this movie so much more than that. The tension throughout the moment we discover canon events to the very end, the sadness of Miguel's treatment of Miles and the sadness of Gwen trying to reach out to her dad was incredible. Whether it be the music, plot, characters, etc etc this movie was always on point and emotionally compelling. I definitely cried during the Gwen scene and geared up when Peter B explains why he had Mayday. After finishing this movie I had to take hours to process it all.It's hard to rate a middle film without getting the entire picture of the wider story it contributes to since it doesn't really have a self-contained ending that will tie up the themes and elucidate the quality of the various beats in this story, but I think how this made me feels deserves nothing less than a 10/10 and I see no issue with anything about this story.",positive
574,"First time I watched it I was a little overwhelmed by the style and fast paced nature of the film. There's so much going on you can't really take it all in until you've watched a second time. Then I realised that it's incredibly stylish, fun and modern. And the new characters are all knockouts especially Spider-Man 2099 and Hobie, enjoyed watching this back on my projector, feels like a normal tv wouldn't do the film justice, it needs to be big. So many different Spider-Man was very cool even though you couldn't really see who's who because there was so many. Plus the ending is especially strong, as you get sucked into it and forget it is a two parter so the end is very strong. And same as the first film, the soundtrack is amazing, Swae Lee, Post Alone, Future and even Nas. It definitely helped to listen to that before the second watch. Right up there with the best CBM's ever like Logan, Spider-Man 2, The Dark Knight, The Batman, Infinity War etc.",positive

576,"This would be a 10 except no one warned us that this movie strangely ends right in the middle of a fight scene and it's tainted by the new evil empire's political ideology being pushed on us throughout. Hollywood can't miss an opportunity to indoctrinate kids in America. But if that were removed then the story and execution of the unique artistic style would have landed this thing at a 9 or 10. I am sure my review gets buried due to the giant corporation that owns this platform being told what they are allowed to promote by their left wing overlords, but it is a solid first half of a movie so see it once it comes out on a streaming platform. Not worth giving more money to the ""cause"" of our new dictatorship.",neutral
577,"It was beautiful, heartfelt, truly amazing...But I HATE it.Why? Because it's not done yet; it isn't even close to finishing. You're just left hanging on the threads as the story slowly, excruciatingly unwinds. You're left waiting on the edge of your seat for that grand finale, that culmination of build-up, that magnificent climax... But it never comes. It never delivers.This is my biggest gripe of the movie - There. Is. No. Payoff.It ends on a goddamn cliffhanger. And it's not a conclusive ending kind of cliffhanger either. No, they left the movie off on the rising action of the story - the literal BEGINNING of the story.I don't understand why so many recent movies decided on implementing such unsatisfactory endings only to advertise the next movie that's supposed to come months, or even years, later. This isn't a TV show; the least you could do is finish it. Even Avengers: Infinity War was more satisfying than this. Why? Because it had a conclusive story; the narrative arc was still completed even though it wasn't the last of its series.But look, maybe I came off too harshly. Across the Spider-Verse is good - way too good for its own good. It's because it's so good that the inconclusive ending infuriates me even more. The character development, the visual aesthetics, the heartfelt narrative - these are all so preciously presented to us with such delicacy. The foreshadowing, the build-up - it's all so subtle; it's written so well... And yet, I have to wait for the next movie to come out for the story to end. I had to walk out of that movie theater wondering if I should've just watched something else for the price of my ticket. Why? Because Across the Spider-Verse is worth half a ticket. The other half is coming next year. And if you'd like to know if this is a good movie, I'd say one thing -""Why yes. This is an extravagant, wonderful, superb... introduction to the next movie.""(Seriously, just give me a four hour movie already. I'll sit through it all. I promise! There's no need for any of this stuff.)",positive
578,"Rating: 7.5 out of 10Positives:
The animation and artwork is inventive & breathtaking. Every frame is a burst of energy with colorful visuals and meticulous attention to detail.All the characters and interesting and are beautifully written.The development and growth of Miles Morales was done well. I twas amazing to see how far he's come since the first film.All the jokes land. The slapstick & sarcastic humor was cleverly written & none of the jokes ever felt forced or cringy.Negatives:
The first half of the movie drags out a great deal and the last 20-30 minutes were painfully dragged out as well.I found the whole Gwen Stacy storyline uninteresting & I just didn't like her character as a whole. She gives me the ick for some reason. I also dislike how they made her the co-star. Can it not just be entirely focused on Miles for once?Verdict:
Overall Across the Spider-verse is a good sequel, but sadly it doesn't capture the charm and depth of the original.",positive
579,"After quite enjoying the first one and seeing all the hype about this one I was quite confident I'd enjoy this sequel. Unfortunately I was stunned by the product in the end. The first movie to me developed very likable characters through really good dialogue. Instead of growing these characters further they became much more bland and the conversations stale.There is no real introduction to the villain at all and you just get thrown into this seemingly endless battle chase scene. It also looks like the movie really wants to be 3D but they ultimately decided against it. Ultimately the graphics became annoying and just gave both people in my party a headache.The movie might be great for super-fans of Spider-Man as you will certainly get your fix in the Spider-verse, but if he's not exactly your favourite superhero it is a bit exhausting.The ending did have me intrigued with the direction they're headed nevertheless.",positive
580,"""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, thus setting the bar very high for any future sequels.This one knocked it out of the park. It has joined that small cinematic pantheon which is home to what I think is the rarest feat in the film industry, one which is occupied by ""Godfather II"" and ""Aliens"": a sequel that is as good as -- or perhaps even better than -- the original.The film's visual style is eye-catching, allowing the makers to do things that are virtually impossible for live-action films, but that is not what makes this movie so good.In this era of CGI, good-looking movies are a dime a dozen; people expect it now. What sets this film apart from its brethren is its heart. Here we see these ""superheroes"" drops their masks, showing the pain and anguish that comes from the difficulties of normal on top of just normal living, and how those experiences have shaped them into who they are and why they do what they do.I want to give a special shout out to all of those involved in the role of Miles O'Hara, one of the film's two antagonists: the writers, the directors and actor Oscar Isaac. He and Miles Morales share wildly opposing views on how to go about saving people; they are both firmly entrenched in their views, both thinking they are right, and this makes for some truly great cinema.I am very curious to see if this movie gets another Academy Award Nomination for Best Animated Film.",positive
581,"It is extremely rare to be able to experience something like this for the first time. A move you will never forget.The fact alone that EVERY single frame of this movie is a stunning piece of art gives this a 8/10 alone, add to that a funny, engaging story that doesn't seem to penalize any of the protagonist's own individual stories coupled with very good pacing makes this a 10/10 would recommend again.It's sad that you can't really get the experience of the first watch ever again, which I wish I could.The story is not complete yet, we can look forward to a hopefully equally as beautiful ending in less than a year's time from now, incredible work the animation team has done.Wow.",positive
582,"I love Into the Spider-Verse, it's one of my favourite animated films of all time, it was so impressive and very entertaining , so of course expectations are high with Across the Spider-Verse, I saw it yesterday in IMAX and.. I think I love it as much as Into the Spider-Verse, it not better, it was definitely a full blown experience that was worth every second of it.It has everything that makes animation just special and unique, the big story, outstanding visual styles, gripping drama and amazing characters with funny comedy, I was engaged throughout the film and by the end, I did need to have a think about this unforgettable experience, since it left me with so much mixed emotions, laugher, tears, chills and even getting shocked in some places, it just shows how a sequel can be so much effective and big.So yeah, love it, absolutely love it!, exactly the kind of film we need, it respects animation and cinema at it's best, the best film of the year and nothing can beat it I'm sure, go see it when you can, it's worth the big screen experience.It deservedly gets 10/10.",positive
583,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings back into the animated multiverse with Miles Morales returning as Spider-Man. The film kicks off with an encounter that leads Miles into another dimension, introducing new Spider-People, challenges, and a threat that travels the boundaries of reality. As Miles grapples with personal dilemmas and the fate of the multiverse, the film promises a visually stunning and emotionally resonant journey. That being said, there were plenty of things I enjoyed about this film, such as cinematography, editing, story strengths and weaknesses, marketing, and reception by the community.Cinematography: The visual effects of ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" are nothing short of amazing. The animation style continues to push boundaries, seamlessly blending different art forms and animation speeds to create a visually stunning experience. Each dimension is a vibrant scene, with aesthetics that showcase the creativity of the animation team.Editing: The editing in this sequel maintains the energy established in the first film. The seamless transitions between dimensions and action sequences contribute to a sense of continuity while keeping the audience engaged. The use of split-screen and comic book-inspired visual elements adds a layer of complexity that enriches the storytelling, considering that Spider-Man had gotten his fame from a comic book.Story Strengths: The narrative of Across the Spider-Verse excels in its ability to balance intense superhero action with believable character development. Miles Morales continues to be a relatable protagonist, and the introduction of new Spider-People brings fresh supporting characters to the story. The film builds on the multiverse concept, expanding the scope of the Spider-Verse in ways that are both inventive and emotionally resonant by connecting all of the movies together.Story Weaknesses: While the film admirably juggles multiple characters and dimensions, some subplots may feel slightly rushed. Certain emotional moments, though impactful, might leave viewers wishing for more exploration. However, these are minor events in the grand tapestry of the Spider-Verse.Marketing and Reception: The official trailers generated significant excitement by showing the film's stunning visuals and promising an even more ambitious narrative. Posters featuring the diverse array of Spider-People created anticipation for the multiverse aspect of the movie, people waiting for certain pop culture references in the movie. Since the release of the movie, social media reactions have been overwhelmingly positive, with fans praising the animation, storytelling, and the film's ability to expand the Spider-Verse. The marketing strategy has advanced on the success of the first film while promising a exciting experience.Final Verdict:
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse not only lives up to the high expectations set by its predecessor but surpasses them with a stunning and emotionally charged adventure. The film's strengths lie in its groundbreaking animation, dynamic characters, and a narrative that seamlessly stays true to the kid named Miles. While it may have minor pacing issues, the overall experience is a testament to the creative possibilities of animated storytelling.Rating: 9.6/10.",positive
584,"Not just in his character, but the way his story is interwoven with the entire spidey-verse is just plain genius. The amount of callbacks and references throughout was a delight, and none of it felt forced. Everything flowed naturally with the story. Some are saying the film is a bit too long. I disagree. I would've sat there for another 2 hours just to see how this story is going to end, and what else they could've done with this art style. My booty would've been sore, but my mind would've been a happy camper! If you do decide to see this, which you 100% should (it may be the best film of the year, but still too early to tell), see it in the IMAX format. It's absolutely breathtaking and you can really see the attention to detail put into the absolutely jaw dropping artwork on display here. Overall, I highly recommend it. Bring the whole family. You'll be enchanted by the story, while the kids will be distracted by the artwork and awesome chase sequences.5 spideys out of 5.",positive
585,"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a hyperactive techno-dream of super-heroic proportions, and it's the (presumably) penultimate chapter of The Spider-Verse Saga. And what a Saga it is so far!Spider-Man's easily one of cinema's most iconic superheroes and he's had to endure some REAL triumphs and headaches along the way (for every Spider-Man 2, there's an Amazing Spider-Man 2). And Across The Spider-Verse is another defining chapter in Spider-Man's storied legacy on the big screen.This one's gonna have some strong praise for it, and there's gonna be detractors saying it's not as well-rounded as the first (both situations are understandable), but what the film does right it does it in proud strides. It's like an arthouse Spider-Man film that knows fan-service has its own depths of character and history, and the lines between animation and live-action are virtually non-existent in the Spider-Verse.For such a tried-and-true character like Spider-Man, it's pretty damn surprising and refreshing the Spider-Verse films are as solid as they are. Sure some of the world building may have SOME plot-holes regarding the machinations of multiverse logic, but its playbook is easily the most creative one in cinema today. And by far the nuttiest too.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is running laps around its competition right now, and it's one of those rare examples where a sequel deserves every ounce of praise it gets. Toy Story had that same magic (up to Toy Story 3); now Spider-Man's Spider-Verse is taking its crown.Rock-solid story, chaotic visuals and deep characters that are bigger than one universe alone. 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.",positive
586,"I wish the trailers didn't show so much, because i kinda felt like i saw the entire plot of the movie on the trailers.The story is quite simple, but it is a classic spider-man dilema story. The main story kinda starts halfway through the movie, the first act is mostly about Spider-Gwen backstory.Other than that, the movie ends in a cliff hanger.The visual stuff is a masterclass in animation, and the multiverse is explored far better here than in the MCU, showing us very different universes, including some call backs to live action movies. II would need to see a second time to really make my mind. But overall i think it was entertaining, although i'm not sure it's a masterpiece, maybe it has to do with the fact that the story isn't finished and we have to wait for part 2 to see the resolution.Maybe after part 2 i will appreciate this one more. But overall it's worth watching on cinemas. Plenty of cameos from other things (videogames, movies, comics), great music, and very dark story at times.",positive
587,"The MCU's struggling to find new focus on anything post Avengers: Endgame, and this film is probably THE ideal blueprint for how other filmmakers can tackle the all-encompassing wackiness of multiverses, especially with a character as beloved and established as Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse was originally a Part I, but then Part II became Beyond The Spider-Verse (which is due next year), and it's clear these films are becoming the Toy Story equivalent for animated superhero cinema. The characterisations are air-tight, the screenplay knows the difference between metaphysical craziness and intimate character arcs, and the animation goes above and beyond in terms of remixing itself with SOOOO many different styles and vibes.First and foremost, the primary story focuses on Miles and Gwen, and how the Spider-Verse is making their lives all the more crazy and larger than they ever dreamed of. And it's also about making peace with their vigilante careers, and accepting that they're part of something bigger than Spider-Man alone. And nothing's getting in the way of compromising who they are deep down: compassionate heroes who'd risk themselves for the greater good.A sequel that's bolder and bigger than its already great precursor, Into The Spider-Verse, that this film leaves you wanting more in the BEST way possible. And this cliffhanger: it's a doozy. It brings the film's arcs to a close yet leaves them open enough that they'll lend themselves to Beyond The Spider-Verse (hopefully) rather nicely.Across The Spider-Verse is even crazier than Into The Spider-Verse, and it manages to complement the film rather than 'overtake' it in terms of relevance. Here's hoping Beyond The Spider-Verse delivers what it promises us.I give Across the Spider-Verse 10/10 IMDb points. 5/5 stars.P. S. This film's craziness... needs to be SEEN to be believed! Hell, this might be THE proverbial metaphysical film of 2023.",positive
588,"June 5 2023 ,
liberty cinemas kannurAcross the Spiderverse pushed and pulled off the visuals, the comic style and aesthetics much better than it's predecessor (except for some of the painted bits showcased during the opening sequence which felt overdone and oversmooth) and delivered some really exciting linkups and solid entertainment through it's multiverse exploration and possibilities along with a vibey soundtrack even if it wasn't anywhere as cool as the one we got to rock with through Into the Spiderverse.But the scattering of the storyline with focus on the individual life and events of a handful of spider people aside from Miles Morales......
even if that gave each of them a breathable space which also felt appreciable btw, I just didn't feel the emotional connectivity it brought in and their storyline and the conflicts they were facing too didn't interest me much apart from the central conflict that Miles was facing, the one involving his dad and his questionable superhero existence.The cliffhanger too felt disappointing as the final and shocking new character appearance wasn't that at all coz of the predictability running around it and so i am not really hyped up for Beyond the SpiderVerse.This was by no means a bad movie, it's actually definitely an above average one and objectively obv currently being hailed as one of the best/the best comic book movie but i was expecting for the storyline to be more exciting and fresh along with being hyped up for the visual style and spider society....
Well I guess I shouldn't have wished for to get them all as it satisfied me with the visual style but for the rest of it... I definitely can't say the same.",neutral

I did not like it enough, it was not memorable enough and it was more interested in leaving it all to a sequel.Miles Morales has to deal with a villain called The Spot. He was an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals during a collider explosion. He now blames Miles for his condition as he also brought a spider from another dimension that bit Miles, giving him spidey superpowers.Meanwhile Miles collides with Gwen Stacy, although she is from another dimension as well, where she is also Spider-Woman.In short Miles and Gwen as well as others chase the Spot through the multiverse. Only the Spot has plans of his own.The film starts off slowly, a crawl before getting supercharged. It just lacks the punch and effervescence of the first movie in this cartoon series.",neutral

And it's a rush, an absolute blast for anyone looking for a summer escape.I love that the writers spend so much time on Miles and Gwen, their relationship, their struggles with expectation, and to see them go for a swing through NYC is just ... I love that vibe, man. In such a headlong flight of a story, it's refreshing to see Miles' social and family lives fleshed out.But it is a full-tilt movie, and once it starts dealing with the actual Spiderverse, it's chaotic, breathless and a welcome sensory barrage of color and eye-popping animation. It is a theme park ride, and one I'd absolutely do again.This continues to be the most unique, character-authentic series of Spider-Man movies and I am unquestionably a fan.",positive
591,"Firstly, this movie has some great visuals, action, and music. I felt these three aspects exceeded or maintained the same level of greatness from the first movie. The pacing like the first movie is quick but not necessarily too fast. With all these positives I felt the greatest letdown was the plot/writing. The overall plot was more interesting than the first movie. However, it has some major plotting issues. These plot issues comes from the justification of characters' actions and the unquestioning of others on said justification. It is hard to explain without spoiling the movie, but it just seems difficult to believe these characters listen to this particular character without major dissent. Overall great movie but they maybe needed to refine the script a bit better. The ending is polarizing, I really liked it but it could be a let down for others. I was engrossed throughout the movie and never felt the runtime. After another watch I may boost my rating. A fantastic movie with some plotting issues.",positive
592,"People are so insanely creative and talented, I mean I love superhero movies and animated ones but this is next level. The story is brilliant, the humour is great but there's so much to it, there's literally emotions being shown to you via art, colours and textures, it's phenomenally deep and nuanced for a film you'd probably write off as being a kids movie.Script is great, attention to detail is perfect sbc the links to all the other parts of the Spider-Man universes was really clever to, some hilarious cameos and a great nemesis who had the whole audience laughing.I'd actually say I now prefer these to the in real life movies.As close to perfection as possible.",positive
593,"I think this is a good example of the fact that people do not have a superhero fatigue, they just have a limited tolerance for bad movies. This, along with its predecessor, are probably the greatest Spider-Man films of all time. My favorite actor playing Spider-Man, Toby Maguire, but this film shows a believable teenage boy going through the problems of having great responsibility thrust on him. And the animation is stunning. Not only is it breathtaking, but it's expressive. It's some of the best animation in a feature film since the beginning days of Disney. And by that I don't mean cute princesses, but I mean the Psychedelic horror of some parts of Fantasia, the dancing Pink Elephant sequence in dumbo, and the evil queen sequence in snow White. There's a great scene where Gwen is having an emotional moment with her father and the whole color and tone of the animation changes. There are two major flaws with this film though. The first is the ludicrous idea that somehow what happens to spider-Man in is what keeps the universe together. And the other is the ending. The story feels like it can be concluded with a couple of more scenes, they ended it on a cliffhanger they're going to have a lot of filling and padding to extend the length of the next film. But those are minor things to quibble about, this is a masterpiece, the best superhero movies of all time.",positive
594,"First of all, I think this film is more difficult to pull off as it serves as a complement to the main storyline, and Sony seems to have handled it quite well. I don't feel the need to mention the entire team here, but from the director to the set workers, everyone did an excellent job, and the film turned out to be very clean and beautiful.Let me start by talking about the specific best things. First and foremost, the music... The best use of music I've seen recently, and I truly applaud Daniel Pemberton for his exceptional work. The added songs, apart from the instrumental music, are equally wonderful. The second best and most challenging aspect, in my opinion, is the placement of cameos. The inclusion of Andrew, Tobey, Venomverse, MCU, and comic book references is exceptionally well executed and crafted. Their placements are well-balanced without being excessive. For those wondering what cameo usage means, this is it. The first film showed us how different tones and great animation could be achieved, and this film takes it even further. In my opinion, it has the best opening 15 minutes I've seen in recent years. The scenes depicting the Gwen Stacy story and the appearance of Spider-Man 2099 drove me crazy with excitement; they were truly amazing. I can't find the right words to describe it; it falls short of being sufficient. Presenting different universes, adjusting their depths, and maintaining the coherence of the overall narrative while conveying those emotions is truly challenging. This film accomplishes that at an extremely high level. They also summarized Spider-Man 2099 very well, and I hope the character gets more screen time in the third film.In recent years, both animated and superhero films have become artificial, but this film breaks free from those patterns. Let me explain why it is good and how it fills the gaps. For example, the scene where multiple Spider-Man variants chase Miles may be slightly exaggerated, but the film adds small jokes and subtle nuances to those scenes that eliminate the power imbalance and showcase the excellent cinematography. Animation shines in that part and captivates the audience. In other words, it transforms its shortcomings into something different by covering them up. It's simply SPECTACULAR. However, towards the end, Miles knocking out his own Prowler variant with a punch and the occasional heavy emphasis on family drama (although Spider-Man and family conflict are highly plausible, sometimes it felt slightly excessive).Now, let's talk about our villain, SPOT. If Spot suffers a logical defeat or victory in Beyond the Spider-Verse, it will be one of the most interesting and well-crafted villains I have seen in recent years. I can't comment too much on this film specifically, but the clever use of traveling through black holes and its utilization as a means of transportation in some of the aforementioned cameos was brilliant. I hope they continue developing his good motivations without ending it with a weak conclusion. I'm eagerly looking forward to it.In short, it is technically very strong, the animation is fantastic, minor shortcomings are skillfully covered, the music and visuals look amazing on the big screen, Miles' growth is well portrayed, Gwen Stacy is well-developed, her relationship with Miles is balanced, and surprisingly, it serves as a great transitional film (many series struggle with filler films that connect two major events, often leaving plot holes and feeling forced and artificial, but this film serves as a great example in that regard).I hope they can deliver another masterpiece after two already impressive films by minimizing the mistakes and issues I mentioned. Trust me, it's a film that must be watched in theaters, it won't have the same impact when viewed at home. Enjoy watching :)",positive
595,"Miles is in for a treat, the one that's going to make this spider the best in all of the universe and it's this guy, honestly against all odds fighting his true self with the fraude version is something that's gotta be the biggest movie animation plot of all times and it's coming maybe next year being 2024 or maybe later if they don't want to mess it all up, as epic as the cliffhanger has had a deadly toll on me I just can't imagine what's coming next to the big multiverse, and then you've got the spot to turn the tides around for the prowler and the spider and just thinking about that only Chung's the best out of me, I never did thought of morales to be this great if a character that inspires the whole new line of what's about to take place AKA the anomaly AKA miles morales how beautifully touching that Gwen is now ready for the front row bringing in the best of the best against the best out there, ladies and gentlemen the plot of the century and marvel has marvelled it.",positive
596,The first movie was quite original and light hearted. But this sequel is over-stuffed with two dimensional characters and adolescent daddy mommy issues. Quite boring actually. I really wanted to like this. There's no real drama actually.And the animation style is the same with the first one (at best)The spiderverse in the comics made more sense than this one. This somehow is a let down from the comics. The stakes are quite low.Every persona portayed here is already cool without having superpowers. The transformation through the mask is the main story. That's actually quite apparent. But everything is cool and sexy and easy to sell these days.,neutral

598,"What's good: Writing is great, Characters are driven by motive and not plot. Characters make clear choices that are in character. Was expecting a twist but couldn't predict the twists. Thought the 2 twists were written perfectly. Good balance between coming of age and action/adventure which is what every spider-man film is about. Takes the ""canon events"" concept of Spider-Man to the next level and creative story choicesLoved the india world.Why I give it 7: Gwen's world
Honestly it was just too distorted and jarring for me. Every few seconds the colours change, and the colours are triadic and contrasting which made the start way too jarring until it's hard to digest the visual style and action in the other worlds. Some more the film starts and ends in Gwen's world which makes you start and end with overstimulating of the brainAlso, the scenes that are animated upside-down and kaleidoscope format like doctor strange kinda thing in spider society was too distracting for me at times. It's nice for action sequences like the chase between the spidermen and miles but for the emo conversation scene between Gwen and miles seated upside down staring into the city was too much for me because I as am being drawn into the story - the emotions of the characters, I am distracted trying to make sense of distance and space simultaneouslyDon't like Hobie brown as he really looks like a last-min half done whackjob thrown in towards the 11th hour of production. He doesn't fit the whole feel of the filmIn terms of execution (directing) I feel it's a bit too conflated and the world building (like how avatar was done or sing 2 was done) couldve slowed down and let me enjoy the various worlds before getting into the action.",positive
599,"Apparently audiences are bowled over by this overlong, unfinished flashy mess of a movie. The action scenes are fine, that if, if they don't induce nausea and headaches in all but the most ADD-riddled youth. Pandering to current political/identity groups is the M. O. for nearly every character and location introduced. The shallowness and blatant cashing in are grating.When the action slows down, the dramatic scenes pack zero weight whatsoever, despite, or perhaps partly because of the constant experimentation with animation styles. The audience in our theater talked and/or texted through every one of these scenes. I nearly fell asleep. The characters, being sterotypes, are completely flat.Finally, ending a dragging 2 & 1/2 hour movie on a cliffhanger is completely unsatisfying and unforgivable. The movie has no notable character arcs whatsoever. Possibly the worst movie I have seen this year, and we will not be returning for any more of this series.But hey, the bots say it's an all time film classic. This site strains credulity. That, or the opiate of the masses is incredibly weak, reflecting the state of the masses itself.",negative
600,"Spiderman: Across the SpiderverseExactly how a sequel should be - reminiscent of the former movie whilst beautifully building upon it.It's a visual treat, bursting with brilliant and daring animations. Every shot is so stunning that they elicit a 'blink and you miss it' feel.The plot is jumpy, dark and revelatory. Elements from the first movie are deliciously and carefully unfurled. Fanservice and Easter eggs are also abundant. It is also delightful to see how character development is handled. Although the screen time is long, it doesn't become boring or tiring. (Spoiler alert- It ends on a cliffhanger that's so profound and shocking, possibly one of the best I've ever seen, especially as the movie's title doesn't hint at being a 'part one'.)8-9/10.",positive
601,"Across the Spider-Verse is quite possibly the best sequel I've seen in a LONG time.It not only expands upon the original, but represents an improvement in almost every way. By the way, the original is an excellent, 9/10 film too, so...yeah, this is heavy, heavy praise] The visuals are absolutely STUNNING, so much so that multiple times whilst watching this movie, I thought to myself ""how is this even possible?"" I can't recall the last time a live action movie really made me feel that way. The commitment to comic book aesthetic is incredible and lovingly crafted in each frame; but what's more impressive is that this film has the ambition to go beyond even that: blending 3D animation with live action, 2D animated with 3D, mosaics with moving rotoscoped characters. I can honestly say that I feel lucky to be able to watch films in the 2020s, Across the Spider-Verse represents one of the best examples of technology and artistry coming together to make something unbelievably cool.And, the amazing thing is that all of this visual excellence exists in service of a great story. Narratively, Across the Spider-Verse represents a more mature, high stakes, thoughtful, well constructed instalment of the franchise; the characters are relatable and understandable, their motivations clear as day. There's a real humanity to the story, despite the bombast and multiversal storytelling. At its core, its about family, identity, self-discovery, community...universal themes that anyone could get behind. There are also so many genuinely great performances bringing these characters to life; shout out in particular to Daniel Kaluuya and Oscar Isaac, but honestly, the whole cast is great. They're so good that if you told me the voice actors sat down with the animators and saw what they were supposed to look and move like, I'd believe you.Speaking of movement, the action sequences in this film are truly incredible. The fluidity of the characters' movements, the fantastic editing and use of comic book panels (a really valuable tool to ensure everything can be seen), and aforementioned excellent visual effects stack up with the best live action scenes Hollywood has to offer.I also personally believe a superhero tale is only as good as its villain, and wow, this movie did a fantastic job. I love how Spot (played by the excellent Jason Schwartzmann) initially comes off as a joke, only for his true potential (and power) to slowly be revealed throughout the movie. I kind of wish he was in it longer, but Oscar Isaac's Miguel works as another amazing antagonist as well.And the ENDING. MY GOD. Could this movie have set its sequel up even better? My wife and I were sitting in the theatre, ready for another half hour or so, expecting the climax only to realize when the music began to swell that it was over. I was genuinely so impressed with how well the filmmakers put all the chess pieces on the board for the next one. However, because of that, if there was one thing keeping this movie from being perfect to me, it's that the ending isn't here yet. It still feels like half of a movie, so how this movie really stacks up in the grand scheme of things is unknown until Part II.Into the Spider-Verse represented a revolution in American animation, where the Pixar style commitment to replicating the real world was eschewed in favour of fluid, unapologetic, stylized animation (so much so that Pixar itself is copying Sony Pictures Animation). I feel like Across the Spider-Verse is throwing the gauntlet, passionately arguing that animation could and SHOULD be taken as seriously as live action.",positive
602,"Eric's Grade: A
'Across the Spider-Verse' is the animated sequel to 2018's 'Into the Spider-Verse' and is set to be followed by 'Beyond the Spider-Verse'. With Sony's ownership of the Spider-Man character this is their conduit for continuing to tell Spider-Man stories, and, while Peter Parker makes an appearance, this is once again a Miles Morales led story who is probably the most popular non Peter Parker Spidey from the comics. There are numerous recurring roles from the first film foremost among them being Shameik Moore as Miles, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales and Brian Tyree Henry as Jeff Morales. Notable supporting voice cast includes Oscar Isaac as Miguel O'Hara, Issa Rae as Jess Drew and Jason Schwartzman as the Spot. 'Across the Spider-Verse' uses the same stylized animation and carries over the feel and tone from the first film flawlessly. That achievement is made more impressive by the fact none of the directors are the same from the first film and the only writer that remains the same is Phil Lord. This will certainly land on numerous end of the year lists and is easily a frontrunner for Best Animated Feature. 'Across the Spider-Verse' is a tremendous box office success as well taking in over $680 million at the box office on $100 million budget.We initially encounter Gwen Stacy from the previous film who, in the midst of a battle with an enemy that has spilled over from the multiverse, reveals to her father that she is Spider-Woman. When he shuns her she turns to the Spider-People who have showed up and they grant her acceptance/asylum in there multiverse Spider-society. Meanwhile Miles is doing his Spider-Man thing his way on Earth-1610. He laments the loss of love interest Gwen, has typical awkward teenage interaction with his parents and battles evil super villains with his own brand of Spidey humor mixed in. One such villain is The Spot and is easily foiled by Spider-Man although, little does Miles know, this villain shall return much more powerful, determined and ruthless than before. All of a sudden Gwen returns, but she is a tad stand offish and secretive. Miles discovers that she is part of a secret Spider-Society headed by Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Man 2099. Miles follows Gwen into a portal to the Spider-Society's HQ where he discovers, to his shock, why he has been generally shunned by this society, and why all of a sudden the majority of the Spider-People turn against him. He flees seeking to write his own story and not have it written for him. He flees to save himself and his family. He flees into what he thinks is relative safety until a fairly massive plot twist leads into a cliffhanger ending that will leave fans drooling for the third installment of this series.Holy Spider-People Batman! If you thought the handful of odd Spidey's from 'Into the Spider-Verse' was jarring wait until you encounter a world(dimension?) full of them. There is so much going on in this movie that it is hard to quantify. The action and animation are stellar along with all of the voice cast. There is some genuine, heartfelt emotion that comes through as well with regard to Miles and his family, Gwen and her father and Miles and the Spider Society including Gwen. For the most part the writers do an excellent job of reigning in a very confusing, chaotic subject and keeping it focused and coherent. That said there are a few story elements that don't quite make sense to me. The crux of Miguel's fixed intensity at Miles is that Miles is an anomaly that was never meant to be Spider-Man due to the fact the spider that bit him was from another reality. If that is truly such a bad thing though I have no understanding why Miguel and his transdimensional Spidey task force allow Miles to go unmolested until he literally shows up at Spider HQ. Also if Gwen truly knew what was going on I have no understanding why she ever went back to visit Peter putting him, and the fabric of reality, in tremendous danger. Besides that..... pretty solid. I had a blast with this. I recently re-watched 'Into the Spider-Verse' and loved it more than I remembered. This is essentially more of the same just expanded to the point that it will melt your brain.... In a good way! The twist cliffhanger ending is a stroke of genius that ranks up there with some of the best cliffhanger endings ever in movies. For a two and half hour run time, which is the longest ever for an American animated film, the movie flies by. It would honestly be difficult to make this movie better, and I cannot wait for future Miles Morales content in this wondrous Spider-rific world.",positive
603,"My expectation bar was already high, because of first movie, but even with it this was much better, than I expected. We could see old fantastic characters, but they also introduced us some new personas, that are interested and have their own style. Music there isn't much better in compare to first movie, but It doesn't mean there aren't any good songs, because almost all of them are good, even few are awesome, but there isn't this one incredible like Sunflower in first movie. Story doesn't fell into repetitiveness and show something different, than in first movie, so you don't get bored. The best thing in this film is graphic. It look do majestic and wonderful, that you can't stop looking at it. Every frame is a their own masterpiece. Can't wait for the next and sadly last part!",positive

The ending was great, hate in was a cliffhanger but I'll definitely see the next movie the minute it comes out. Overall this movie was better than what I could hope for I think it's better than the first one but maybe after I rewatch it I'll decide. Can't freaking wait to see what happens next.

606,"Honestly, i think the movie is overhyped. I mean, I get that there is a revolution on how animation movies are being done now since the first spiderman movie (animated) But there was something about the fast paced of this movie that was so hard for me to digest it all, and even appreciate it.I am 28 yrs old, maybe im getting old, but the movie had so much potential for getting a very high score. The continuous visual stimuli was just too much for me. But definitely, the style of artistic creativity in the animations is somehtin to admire. But to say this is a 10/10 sorry but the Joker for instance would deserve a higher score than what this currently has.",neutral
607,"It's truly incredible how good of a follow-up this is to one of the best comic book films ever. The fact they managed to craft this compelling of a story without it feeling forced is amazing. I was full invested in everything happening and couldn't believe the end of the film came so soon. That; however, would be the one aspect holding me back from a perfect score, as this almost feels like an incomplete film given the lack of resolution with Miles' story. However, Gwen is arguably the co-lead of the film and she gets some nice resolution with her arc.Speaking of Gwen, the visuals utilized for her world were truly out of this world. Having the colors of the world sync with her emotions really gave this a unique feel. The rest of the visuals in the film were of course exquisite as well.There are SO many nods and references to Spider-Man across media and I loved every second of it. Lord and Miller continue their impeccable track record of clever writing with genuinely funny dialogue. I hope we see more of Miguel O'Hara in the sequel, as he is a fascinating character superbly voiced by Oscar Isaac. I must also make note of the incredible score. It might be even better than the first film with its whirlwind of electric sounds and vibes.Across the Spider-Verse stands as one of the best sequels ever and one of the best comic book films of all time. I really cannot recommend this film enough if you're interested in going on an incredible multi-versal journey full of heart and soul.",positive
608,"This movie was so incredibly boring I wanted to leave the theater. I LOVED the first spider verse film and I love Miles as Spider-Man but despite the incredible animation, this film was like watching paint dry. I can't overstate how disappointed I was while in the theater...Gwen's entire storyline could have been removed and maybe the movie would have been tighter but unfortunately it was a long, unnecessary mess. Hollywood has to milk every franchise that they have and made a film that could have been done in one part- as a two parter for more money.I was incredibly excited for another spider verse film and unfortunately I couldn't wait for it to be over while watching it.",negative
609,This is the greatest superhero movie I've ever seen the animation is cinema. This is the type of movie everyone needed. The development for miles and Gwen is absolutely stunning I loved spider punk and spider man India. As for spider man 2099 he was a great and cold character. The only con that I really have is the ending however it will get you extremely excited for the next movie beyond the spider verse. And I love the action in this movie and it utilises the multiverse in ways we've never seen before and it isn't there just to get viewers in with nostalgia.Overall a stunning movie 11/10 amazed!,positive

I hope the movie will be 3 and a half hours long A new style of drawing, animation and fighting scenes, as if I am watching anime and not movie animation. From my point of view, I see that drawing and animation is better than anime. So far, I am definitely amazed. I will definitely watch it again, and the first part.",positive

All my minor gripes about Into the Spider-Verse are absent and in its place captures the panel-to-panel thrill of reading your first ever Spider-Man comic. Smart, imaginary and completely unrestrained, Across the Spider-Verse might just be the very best Spidey movie ever made in what is an extravagant, very cool love letter to graphic design, executed with superb draftsmanship and giddy, infectious joy.It does lose half a star for the lack of The Emissary from Hell himself (also no 90s Christopher Daniel Barnes Spidey, but that's a personal peeve), although I bet good money he'll be in the next one.",positive
612,"I won't waste my time searching for adjectives to eulogize this movie with because I don't know if I can come up with enough to justify how much I enjoyed it. I will say that I didn't expect it to be this good. Frankly, I was a bit worried because how do you top a movie like ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" with a sequel? Answer: This movie is how you do it. Plot-wise, the film is on a grander scale than the first. The stakes are higher, I think the action is more intense, and the setting is broader -- still the multiverse, but we go more in-depth into how they're connected in this movie. The film introduces more characters and makes it work so well without ever feeling overstuffed. We're given a glimpse into these characters' lives; just enough to keep us invested without distracting from the movie's main conflict. The pacing of this movie is freaking spectacular, as it just keeps getting better and better. Cliffhangers are never fun for me, but this one did not leave me anxious or confused. I anticipated it because the film built the plot steadily without resorting to cramming a reserved segment with too much information. The climax was saved for the end, and it paid off well. The writing just slaps at every turn, balancing out the film with the right amount of humour, heart and wit. The soundtrack sounds so good in the context of the movie and honestly elevates the experience. The animation is still as fun, vibrant and innovative as ever. I initially thought the art style used to portray Gwen Stacy's universe was a bit distracting, but the use of colour is brilliant and almost makes me forgive the elusiveness. This is just all-around perfection, and it's refreshing to see a superhero flick still deliver this level of quality, much less a sequel. I am only excited for the next one, and ""excited"" is a modest choice of words.",positive
613,"The movie from the beginning was a a complete masterpiece with Gwen's backstory and how she got where she was in the movie. I don't want to spoil too much but what I can say is that this movie has everything hype, nostalgia, sad moments, happy moments, realization moments, and goosebump moments. It had one of the best written stories ever it had good pacing, character development, animation, perfect sequences, etc.. it had everything and the spot is easily one of the most fearsome villains in fiction and he truly feels like a villain when I watch because he makes me even more excited for the trilogy. Miles was even better in this movie than the First one and spider punk was easily one of the best characters in the film by far.

616,"The first movie was quite original, epic, emotional and to be honest by far the better movie than this sequel. In my opinion the story of the first movie was somehow better and more intimate without tons of characters. Instead, It focused on several characters, including the villain, and they were all perfectly developed as 3 dimensional. We had an incredibly inspiring story (Leap of fate) and the tone was more serious. Moreover, we actually had a perfect ending and overall the movie was an absolute blast from start to finish. As I already mentioned, the problem of the sequel is that I feel the story is all over the place. It is actually a good simple story with plenty of potential, but the focus is deprived due to hundreds of other characters. The cinematography and the visuals on the other hand are insane and out of this world, just mesmerizing. However, same thing happened with Avatar 2 - amazing visuals, but the actual movie is not a masterpiece as the reviews are saying. When you think for a sequel in a franchise, you recall that there are movies like Terminator 2, Empire Strikes Back, Infinity War, The Dark Knight or Spider-man 2. Across the spider-verse isn't any of these movies. For instance, you can't compare the not so exiting cliffhanger of across the spider-verse with the ending of Infinity War. Maybe they should have spent more time establishing the villain of the story and we could have seen an epic conflict with Miguel Spider-Man 99 and Miles instead of the ending we got. I mean we should have gotten an ending similar to Infinity War or Empire Strikes back when Luke confronted Vader. They had all the potential there but couldn't use it perfectly. I hope that in the third part they will stick to the serious tone instead of babies, because I felt that the first movie was more mature and the second more childish. The plot of Miles being a ""Mistake"" is just too perfect to be overshadowed by introducing hundreds of characters with plenty of humor. I just want the more serious, dark and profound movie and I still hope that the third one will deliver it just like the original masterpiece.",positive
617,"A continuation of the journey of ""Miles Morales"", Spider-Man, and his experience in opening hidden worlds for him. The film was distinguished by an impressive and elaborate way of drawing and animation, full of different colors and themes that make you not miss a single second of the film, with voice performances from various characters. The fight scenes are very elaborate and the musical background is suitable for each scene of the movie. The elements of evil were very convincing in their causes and sometimes made you stand with them neutrally and posed a real danger to the hero of the movie.",neutral
618,"I understand the business side of the film industry is going to take over when the people running the studios decide the profit margins aren't where they want them. To me this POV explains the decision to give us half a movie with this installment of the Spider verse.This is the second cliffhanger film I have seen this year. The second part of Fast X will not be released until 2025. The next Spider verse film won't be released until 2024.Tarantino did this with Kill Bill, and I disliked this lack of a finale then.Stop doing this, Hollywood honchos. No one should have to wait 12 months (or more) for an ending to a film.",neutral
619,"What the hell happened ? The first into to spider-verse had some great animation and drive this one is 2h 20m long and the first 40min is terribly bad to sit through there is not much of a story we get gwen's story first then miles again their similarities a touch of romance builduing up and lots of arguing/family problems.Some action scenes can't decide if they want to tell a story or be action hey let's do both and fill that with music while moving dynamically that is how *#$ 70% of this movie felt constant moving often towards the center while the perspective swings a bit it is tiresome and often felt like i wqas watching a music video also the early parts the bakground and splashes are toned heavily in pinkish that i nearly got a headache. Actually the whole movie is tinted in pink highlights and blue linework but an aggresive pink that really got on my nerves and my headache expanded because of it.We get some ridicolously stupid alternative spideys like the pregnant biker or the indian spidey where somehow the city falls apart not anything trying to make sense for the sake of the action ""side-story"" telling. Often the humor fell completly flat and the action animation in key scenes wasn't good enough. It toook 1h 30 mins of that numbness till we finally get somewhere that the movie is starting to take a direction also parts of before are being explained what a pain i am sure i won't rewatch these messsy parts of the movie that was so unpleasant if i was in the cinema i would step outside for a moment to recollect myself washing away the sheer disappointment of this in comparion to the precedessor.Final hour still mostly hiccups no real finale another music video chase more drama trying to to push in some fanfare here and there. Doing the most unbelievable i am spiderman reveal by now. Also it seems like time or money ran out to make everything look decent because now the backgrounds are trash. End is a cliff hanger with our Villain at least revelaed hm i guess something is wrong with the movie if there was so little to screentime for a villain in 2h 20m some would argue spot was one but no he was just a catalyst to make things happen.Pointing spidey meme 10/10 no this isn't a steam review. But It is cool to see some Spideys in their reserved comic style.I knew it was a hoax since they are milking it into two parts, this part so far was hyper thin in telling a real story but better throw in countless easter eggs sidejokes generic coming of age story and make it a music video yeah they cooked some would say but the result tastes weirdly bland in a bad way.",positive
620,"""Into the Spider-verse"" was one of my TOP 3 cinema experiences EVER. The story, the humor, the build-up, the pay-off, the music, and the booming score by Daniel Pemberton somehow managed to intertwine into a spider web of perfection. Oh, and the most magnificent animation to ever grace the silver screen wasn't a shabby accomplishment either.Fortunately, the new trio of directors captured the look, feel, and heart. BUT I think ""Across the Spider-verse"" didn't quite surpass the first movie. At times it was less immersive than it could have been (sound mixing, noticeably less crisp and more muffled animation, Daniel Pemberton's score not packing as much of a punch, some pacing flaws), nor did we get the deserved pay-off ... yet!AND YET, what this movie has in droves is an incredibly inventive story that sets up and builds up things for what is sure to be a bombastic final installment, a powerful, symbolically meaningful, and scary villain we can also empathise with, some great reveals, amazing set pieces that will take repeat viewings to fully appreciate, and it counter-balances this blink-and-you'll-miss-it whishing and whooshing with beautifully crafted quiet moments that allow characters and us to breathe and take in the situation. And it has an ""Empire strikes back"" type of cliffhanger ending that left me wanting more.Which all makes ""Across the Spider-verse"" an absolutely worth successor and a stelllar mid-point. It's not as perfect as ""Into the Spider-verse"" but it easily and deservedly stands proudly right beside it.",positive
621,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a marvel masterpiece, and a top 5 comic book movie of all time, the first one is one of my favorite movies ever, and that goes for this entry too. What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? It is a striking masterpiece, both visually and ethereally, it is absolutely phenomenal in every single way.I have no words for how exquisite this animation is, it improves on the original in so many vastly various ways, the colors pop off of the screen and these workers put their all into it, there are very few movies I've seen that look this good, actually, there's only one.Shameik Moore is absolutely incredible in this movie, Miles's character arc is done to perfection and Miguel O'Hara's backstory was absolutely masterful, this film managed to fit in almost every single piece of Spider-Man media in just 2 hours and 16 minutes, including frickin Spectacular Spider-Man and an insane amount of other things.And the ending cliffhanger was absolutely jaw-dropping, I wish I could build a time machine to take me to the release date of Beyond the Spider-Verse.Across the Spider-Verse is one of the best comic book and marvel movies of all time, and one of my favorite movies that's ever been made, this gets an A double plus.",positive
622,"Into the Spider-Verse is a fantastic movie but I can watch it once or twice. I didn't expect Across the Spider-Verse to be a great movie but oh my God. Was I wrong. I love this movie. The animation is jaw dropping gorgeous, has a ton of heart, creativity, an incredible screenplay and exhilarating pacing. When I heard it was 2 hours, I thought it would drag in some parts but no. It moves so fast, you'll think it's a short 80 minute movie. It tops No Way Home as the ultimate fanservice Spider-Man movie as it has cameos from different Spider-Man cartoons and video games. This movie was so much fun, I didn't finish my popcorn and I walked out of the theater with a smile on my face saying ""Wow!"" I hope it makes $1 billion at the box office. It's one of the greatest movies of all time and sequels since Toy Story 3, Incredibles 2 and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. It will definitely win next year's Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards. It explains the Multiverse better than ""Multiverse of Madness"" and ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"". The scene where every Spider-Man chased Miles had me at the edge of my seat and giddy. It's the most exciting chase scene since The Fugitive and Minority Report. The movie's iconic shot since the Leap of Faith scene is when Miles and Gwen are upside down and so is New York. Everything about this movie is amazing. Go watch it. Stan Lee would have loved this visual masterpiece. He would said ""Excelsior!""",positive
623,"This movie had me hooked from the very beginning. Already I could tell that the animation was going to be unparalleled by almost any other animated movie. The style and the colors give this movie a completely unique feel - even when compared to the first movie. They've upped their game in almost every department. The story is more interesting and is more than just Miles becoming spider-man and saving the day, kind of like the first movie was. The movie is funny and the attention to detail is crazy - there are countless blink-and-you'll-miss-it jokes that are often completely visual and require no dialogue. It makes the movie instantly rewatchable. However I couldn't stand the ending of the movie. It felt like it went on too long to leave enough content for part 3, yet not long enough to have a satisfying conclusion. However, when the story is completed next year, watching part 2 and 3 together, as one long movie, may remedy this. This movie was so good though that they could've just combined both of them into a 4 hour movie and most everyone, the adults at least, wouldn't have complained.",positive
624,"Across the Spider-Verse is such a complete sequel and a more than worthy successor to Into the Spider-Verse.Visually it is such a stunningly rich film, full of vibrancy and creativity. The different worlds are individually crafted to feel unique which makes the film that much more absorbing. The various animation and artistic styles that are used really bring the characters and situations to life. The uses of colour are intriguing and tell a story all on their own. Visually this film is just a real treat.But that's not to say this film is style over substance, because the story is strong throughout. It has pace and drive that really propels things forward, and for such a far reaching story it is handled really well. It never feels like it is overreaching or too padded out, and the runtime breezes by.Another string to its bow is its balance of humour and drama. Lately a lot of superhero films try to be both funny and serious, and the humour ends up undercutting the drama and emotion of the story. Spider-Verse manages to do both exceedingly well. It is a funny film that also packs some powerful emotional and dramatic punches, balancing these two tones very well.To top it all off, the film has a terrific score that further heightens all of the visual and narrative themes to make for a very complete and well rounded film.Just a terrific experience all around!",neutral
625,"Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy are back as they continue their adventures across the multiverse. There are more Spider-people in a whole multiverse organization of Spider-people. Miles is battling a not-so-super villain The Spot.This is a sequel to the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). It's a great follow-up to a great movie. Both have the great animated energy and fun comedy. It's a great continuation and expansion of this multiverse. The teens are a little older and their romance is getting deeper. There are interesting villains. If you love the first one, you'll love second one.",positive
626,"Big letdown even bigger cliffhangerIf you are expecting a lot of the miles story then I would just wait till it comes out on Disney+ or on TV because lots of it was just filler content and I expected a lot more for a 2h+ movie than just some filler content not only do we have to wait a year for the next one but we have to feel unfulfilled in the meantime, wish it was better for a movie that I was so excited to watch. Funny content also some pretty heartfelt scenes but not a lot of action with miles. The movie did have lots of action but still feel unfulfilled after that suspense and having to wait for the movie to come out for the longest time. It was advertised as a wonderful movie but wasn't that ""wonderful"" it was a very good movie but overall a big disappointment because of how it was advertised and how long we had to wait for it to come out.",positive
627,"""Across the Spider-Verse"" is quite simply one of the best comic book films in years as well as a near perfect sequel. It builds upon the already fantastic ""Into the Spider-Verse"" to create a truly captivating, thrilling, and unforgettable experience.The first film contained some of the most visually striking animation ever put to screen. It broke new ground when it came to how animated films are presented and filmed. It is a testament to the quality of Across the Spider Verse that it actually manages to improve upon the art design of it's predecessor while still keeping the genuinely unique style that made the first film so beloved. Almost every shot in Across the Spider-Verse could be framed in a painting. The dazzling visuals are so rich with detail that they often feel as though they pop off the screen. In addition, the extraordinary use of colour in the film in regards to the action and storytelling is absolutely spectacular. The action sequences are also so fast paced and dynamically animated that they can feel almost overwhelming.However, the stellar art design is nowhere near the only thing that makes this film so good. The characters and story are both remarkably well written and relatable. The characters are likeable with complex motivations and are brought to vivid life by an exceptionally talented voice cast. Morover, the dialogue between characters is smart, witty, and flows incredibly well. The story is also a significant improvement from Into the Spider-Verse. It understands the core themes and values of Spider-Man as a character and knows exactly how to challenge, subvert, and build upon them in inventive ways. The story grounds the breathtaking action and otherwordly plot in human emotion which greatly contributes to making the film feel immersive and personal for the audience. Morover, the story contains several incredibly gripping revalations, and moments of intense character drama that will keep you firmly on the edge of your seat.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a generationally great superhero film. With it's awe-inspiring visual style, memorable characters, clever dialogue, and emotional rollercoaster of a story, it is an instant classic and a must see for any Spider Man fan.",positive
628,"I can only review the first half of ATSV as that's when I bailed. Lack of proper sleep the night prior probably helped lead to this decision but my personal opinion was based mostly on writing/direction. Into the Spider-Verse told a really heartfelt, clear story while inserting action sequences, characters, and light humor in all the right places. This film's 1st half does the reverse. Frenetic action throughout while trying to tell a rushed story on the ""fly"". Most of the dialogue was short, snarky remarks. Like the writers went all in on relating to the latest generation and said ""Let's keep intelligent conversation to the bare minimum"". Fight scenes and ""heart-to-heart"" talks were all overshadowed with really lame humor that appeared in much smaller doses in the first installment. Was like 2 failed comedians twirling through multiverses 1-lining each other to death. There were a few serious moments but man did they feel rare and surely lacked depth. The ticket collector failed to give anyone in this viewing 3D glasses and I don't think anyone knew this screening had the capability, so I can't even give rave reviews here and will assume the CGI was next-level. I would only recommend this one in theaters if CGI is truly award-worthy...otherwise a stream when available would suffice.",neutral
629,"I love spiderman, but this.....
It feels like I'm trapped in a disco without a story or main thread. Did all the writers get all of their ideas to go through? 2.5 hours of flashing lights and weird storylines..... This must be what the inside of a brain looks like on a Gen Z...
Have you ever scrolled though a bunch of reels and felt like you just lost a lot of time? That's more or less what this movie feels like. The voice acting was good and I'm sure they did what they could to make it a great film. My son loved it, but he's Gen Z so that might explain alot. I really hope the next Spiderman movie is a better experience, I really do.",positive
630,"Even if I'd had a nice quiet crowd the first time I saw this (I really didn't), this still felt like the kind of movie that demanded a second viewing. Distractions aside, there's just a lot to take in the first time around. The basics are well explained, but the extra/additional details come fast and things that aren't specifically part of the core story can pass by so speedily I couldn't catch as much as I wanted to. A second viewing honestly felt like a first viewing for more than half this movie. I caught a couple more jokes, appreciated the unexpected turns in the narrative (that ending included), and just enjoyed the whole thing a great deal more.I still prefer the first Spider-Verse movie by a hair, because it has a little more emotional weight for me, and I think it's paced a touch better. But Across the Spider-Verse is still emotional and well-paced; I think it flies by so quickly that that ending feels shocking on a first viewing, because the film kind of feels like two acts (with an extended prologue and epilogue) rather than three. The structure's interesting and a little odd, but again, it worked better after seeing it once, and being able to piece it all together while seeing it play out again.And it probably goes without saying, but the animation here is just out of this world. That's the one area that is better than the first, and the first already looked amazing. The music's also just as good, possibly even better. I hope Beyond the Spider-Verse will conclude this trilogy amazingly, and it's probably no exaggeration to say it might be my most anticipated movie of 2024, at least for now (and I'm sure others feel the same way).",positive
631,"Some may say as good as the first, but I would say better. The plot, the animation, the action, the jokes, the characters, the soundtrack, the suspense. Absolute master piece. Saw it on the big screens and it was so worth it.The movie really focuses on Miles finding himself and where he belongs as a growing teen facing many challenges. It explorers his relationship with everyone around him, from his own parents to his friends he left from the first movie. The more in depth concept of the multiverse of spiderman is awesome, seeing the bizarre, new and the popular faces was amazing, the cultural diversity too! Took my children along with me and as whole spiderman fan family, we loved it! Highly recommended and definitely deserves many winning nominations and awards!!",positive
632,"Won't get into details and spoilers as I'm writing this early into it's release but the visuals and animation will leave you bewildered, so much to take in, definitely a cinema necessary experience to capture the beauty of all the hard work put into this film, the bar for animation has been raised so high by this franchise. I was left craving more as the movie ended and cannot wait for the trilogy to be complete, I didn't realize it was a 2-parter and by the time the movie ends you'll be wondering how it went by so fast! They've set up the next movie very well and as a standalone movie I will definitely revisit, let's hope the payoff is good in the next movie.",positive
633,"Given Into the Spider-verse was a top 3 film for me, I was afraid of a let down. The movie did not disappoint. The first movie felt ground breaking visually and this one found a way to step it up. Every world felt so unique and beautiful.The plot itself was strong and gave Miles a unique feel vs the typical Peter Parker story, something even the comics struggled with.It tugged at the emotionally coming of ages strings still. The first movie was all about feeling like fitting in while this movie was about individualism, creating your own path and standing out. This combined with the heartfelt moments with his mother really built upon the coming of age themes. In addition, this movie's emotional weight felt as if it were carried just as much by Gwen's storyline. The opening scenes, the water color emotions with her father and the shift in her storyline felt as emotionally satisfying as the first movie's speech from Miles' father.The music was woven in to the storyline as well as it can be. To contrast, Guardians Vol 3 had great music but with jolting transitions from 2000's pop hit back to the score. Across the Spiderverse opening scene of Gwen drumming and then hitting on the drums again as she gathered the team felt powerful. It did not have the ""leap of faith"" powerful musical moment, but still did a great job nonetheless.Overall the movie was elite visually and incredibly strong emotionally & audibly. The other characters were fun but still served a greater purpose in the plot which elevates the ""fun"" parts above the title of fan service. I understand my own biases toward this type of movie, but this is easily a top ten movie for me which is a 10.",positive
634,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.",positive
635,"To all the haters yes it's a bit long, yes it has few extra one liners that are just ok, yes the pace dips for few seconds here and there but boy oh boy what a ride it was. It was such an breathtaking ride that even the cliffhanger ending did not spoil my mood. When the ending happened it just felt right it needed to stop to take a breath to reflect.How did you plan for this I mean you have to give it to the creators such an incredible talent they are such imagination and then bringing it on to the screen marvellous. How do you beat this, I am worried now whether the next part can match up. They just elevened up in every department. The music always kept me in its verse, The animation was top notch I just can't stop raving about it.I just watched it on Netflix in a 55 inch TV, I can't imagine the experience in theatres must be out of this world. Truly a marvel of a movie. Must get an Oscar highly recommended.",negative
636,"""Spiderman - Into the spiderverse"" was a decent movie that i didn't love as much as some. But it was a fun ride, and a good movie. It was more popular than anyone expected i think. So a sequel was inevitable.This follow up really doesn't mess with what worked before, and takes the insanity of the first up to 100. There's cartoony action, cheeky jokes, plenty of cool references, some heart and even a great twist toward the end. So anyone who liked the first will love this one.I think i'm the only one that finds the crazy colorful animation a bit much at times though. But this time the movie also feels a bit too long, and the ending is frustrating. Still, its pretty entertaining.",positive
637,"Damn, this is great. This sequel lives up to the first movie. In 2018, into the Spider verse was something that for my younger eyes were fresh. But, Across the Spider Verse takes it and goes beyond. This is on a other level of good. Gorgeous level. I'll not spoil anything.This film made me think that no other movie of 2023 will manage to top this for being my favorite movie of the year. It's probably the best Part 1 chapter I've seen, because the next and last movie in the trilogy which is called ""Beyond the Spider Verse"" will obviously be the 3rd part of the story.I feel that this with the first movie are equally good. Across the Spider Verse may be even better than the first one but so far I love both of the films. This film had a lot of surprises that I didn't excepted. This movie is a the gorgeous, the wonderful work of art in terms of aesthetic, story, humor, characters, visuals, cinematography, that EVERYBODY need to see. Just an amazing piece of fiction.",positive
638,"From into the Spider-Verse to across the Spider-Verse, this follow-up has Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy reflecting on her lonely life while evading her own father who happens to be captain of the police force. Meanwhile in a separate dimension, Spider-Man Miles Morales has now emerged as Brooklyn's #1 crimefighter, all while his parents remain in the dark about his secret life. Miles and Gwen then have to team up with their various counterparts to fix a hole in the multiverse. Not as frequently inventive as the first one, but still offers up some good in-jokes and dazzling animation, plus key themes like teenage insecurity, finding one's true self, valuing familial ties, and the sacrifices that come with being a superhero. The plot has a bit too much hemming and hawing, but eventually picks up and delivers an exciting and satisfying (if incomplete) climax. ***",positive
639,"I honestly feel bad for giving a 7 out of 10, because the animation is truly out of this world. The first 30 minutes was great, I loved the parent-children dynamic and even cried during Miles' mom's speech at the party. When we got to the Spider-verse, things got super chaotic with new characters introduced at an extremely fast pace. There are too many things happening all over the place, and slowly I started feeling disconnected with the main characters. I know that a superhero is supposed to break the rules and everything, but I can only see Miles as an angsty teenager who refuse to respect his seniors. Compared to Tom Holland's Spider-Man who is the same age, Miles' character is so unlikeable. The movie dragged on with too many side characters, jokes, and repeated explanations about the multiverse (we get it already, it's literally in every Marvel movie by now) and failed to capture what's essential. When it was nearing 2h20m I finally realized there will be a cliffhanger, but I already lost interest and left my seat before there was an after credit.",positive
640,"This is my first and probably only review around here, but I just watched the movie and I honestly can't understand how it has an overall 8+ rating.I'm not gonna talk about the technical stuff because it's for sure a master piece of animation but the plot and the whole story are just too slow and you can notice since the beginning. The end was by far the worst part, you just can't do a incredible long and boring movie to end it up on a cliffhanger. Avengers movies showed us that you can make a two part movie without the tedious ""to be continue"", that was extremely disappointing.Please stop overrating this movie.",negative
641,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the latest Spider-Man movie, that is animated. I have to admit that I really liked the first movie and was excited for the next one. And my first impression was: wow! Long time since I watched such an epic superhero movie! The plot is basically that Miles Morales (Basically The South-American Spider-Man) have to save the world from colliding with other multiverses and stop a villain called The Spot, that is also about to ruin the world. I want to say more, but I won't because I do not want to spoil. The movie was one great ride. This movie was very fast, so you had to be focused all the time, and It didn't feel 2 and a half hour long, it feelt much shorter. That's because the movie was so fast. The effects were great, I was very impressed. I liked that they made it like a comic-movie, like you got a feeling that you are inside a Superhero comic-book, that was so cool. The music score were well done in this movie, and the cliffhanger at the end was amazing! I really can't wait for the next Miles Morales movie. The characters were showed very good. Miles Morales and his parents do not have the best relationship, and they showed that really good in this movie. Gwen (Spider-Women) was accused for murder by her own father, and she escaped. They showed very good in this movie how bad she feelt. Something that you may have seen in the trailers, like it was also in the movie, that it was many Spider-Mans in the Spider-verse. I think that was very fun and cool. That was one of my favorite things about this movie, actually. Is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, worth watching? I think yes. Especially for Marvel fans, but this movie can be for everyone, if they like action and animated movies. Right now is ""Elemental"" and ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" the best animated movies from 2023 so far.",positive
642,"This might possibly be the best Superhero movie of all time. It is beautiful, heartfelt, incredible, amazing. The ultimate movie. Only downside is it is part 2 of a trilogy and essentially part 1 of a 2 part movie. Ends on a cliffhanger. If Beyond the Spider-verse lands it. This will be the best movie trilogy of all time. Yes. Big words. But a big amazing movie.There may be some who believe it is an incomplete movie. This movie was made in conjunction with Beyond the Spider-verse, set to release March 2024. It is left on a cliffhanger. But that doesn't bother me. Everything about it made me want to walk out and into another theater to see Beyond the Spider-verse right away or even rewatch this film. So much rewatchability.Do yourself a favor and see it on a big screen in theaters. It is wonderful and I hope to go back again and again in Theatres.",positive
643,"I wasn't sure what to expect apart from this being a new follow up story to the very successful, Into the Spider-Verse. I will premise my review with saying I much like many people loved the first film and thought that like a lot of sequels, nothing can top the original film. Well, I have to admit I was wrong. This on so many levels is better still than the first film. The story was very engaging, but the animation, sound, visual effects, even humour, were all amazing! It didn't even feel like the film was over 2 hours long. I would have gladly sat through another hour just for the story to keep going. This leaves the next part for us to have to wait for. I cannot wait for the next chapter in this very creative and amazingly well put together story.",positive
644,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one of the best Spider-Man movies. This was much better than Into the Spider-Verse in my opinion. Other characters besides Miles gets more depth and character development in this film compared to the first.The story is more interesting and has some really good twists and turns. The story is also darker than the first one, which makes it more emotional, which I like. I liked the villains more in this one as well. You understand the villain's motives.The ending was good but still a bit strange without a conclusion. It just ends in the middle of everything, which was a bit annoying. But despite that, it was an awfully good Spider-Man movie. They have set the bar high for the third film now. I can't wait.",positive
645,"This film is the definition of perfection, I literally cannot find any faults with this film. If the first chapter was a masterpiece this one has even surpassed itself, even going beyond what I can consider a wonderful film. I think it is practically impossible to top the graphics of this film, I did not appreciate an animation style in this way that I give a 10/10. Not to mention the fact that this second chapter is only the prologue for what will be (it is assumed) the possible ending of this saga starring miles morales. When I went to the cinema to see Spider-Man across the spider verse I didn't expect such beauty, and instead he managed to greatly exceed my already very high expectations (given the grandeur of the first film). All the beautiful characters, from protagonists to simple extras, really well done, with good stories and funny too, the additions of all these new spider man and the relationship between them is really a touch of class. As I said before: 10/10.",positive
646,"This movie was fantastic, really enjoyed the new characters that were added, they were all really compelling, completely fleshed out and with their own unique backstories, which you would think would be difficult considering that all the charcaters are varients of spiderman, and yet this movie does it really well. They all have great interactions with each other and really seem like real people. The dialouge is just the good. Hobie is my favourite new character. As he was immediately ride or die for Miles and I totally feel that. The new scores for each of the characters was also fantastic. I would really recommend to just take the time to listen to them at home.And was really well passed so that time absolutely flew when watching this movie. There were calm parts and fast moving parts, but it was easy to understand and follow, and kept you engaged the entire time. In fact I was so hooked it to it that when the movie stopped I was like noo, I wanted more. I guess we'll just have to wait for the next one.I would give this one a 10/10 however I didn't like the styling of this movie as much. Don't get me wrong it was still beautiful and I think that what they've done with animation and how they've pushed the limits is really quite incredible, and the art style of say again Hobie I did really enjoy. But like I feel that Miles world was a lot more comic book like in the first movie and was toned down a lot in this one. That is my only dislike for the entire movie. Other wise I absolutely loved it!!!",positive
647,"Animation was perfect . But My problem is that the creators have arranged the world as if everything revolves around Spiderman. And the next point is that the creators have created all the Spider-Man idiots, except for Gwen Stacy's group, even in the movie sometimes Miles Morales looks like an idiot in every sense. The first movie was extremely great, but the second movie defined Spider-Verse in such a way that the whole world was created because of Spider-Mans. Sometimes it is even seen that the movie says that all the dimensions are the same and only their generality is different. But this is not what I like to hear. From my point of view, the animation had problems in terms of bringing together different aspects, but in terms of telling the problems of a teenager with his family, the problems of today's young people, etc., it worked perfectly. I hope the next movie will be better.",positive
648,"The movie is an absolute masterpiece the cinematography, the animation, the storyline it doesn't get any better than this
The movie made me wept, made me smile, made me angry & made me realize the importance of being good all within a 2 and a half hour span, it will surely be one of my highlights of the the year
The movie picks up a few months after the events of the last one but it doesn't loose its tempo at all rather it exceeds it the most wonderful & spell bounding thing about this movie os not only the animation but olso the story line, it shows the real side of spiderman the one we rarely often explore in live action movies it's very hones in it's storytelling the real ups and downs and the sacrifices spiderman has to make to keep the city safe, olso a bighl shout out to the cast and crew & the vfx artists who have worked tirelessly on this you guys have created a masterpiece.Cant wait for the next one :)",positive
649,"Again, the movie Spider-Man: Across The Spider Verse has great visual effects, a pure eye-stunning if you don't care the plot so much.To me, the relationship between Gwen and Miles is not convincing and can hardly be related to. The character, Gwen, served one purpose and one purpose only: To move the plot forward. A tool to tell the story, instead of being a real character, living. The very affection of Gwen feels for Miles (and vice versa) is hasty, based on nothing (at least in this film) and obviously no any tension between them.Another thing is I felt very, very uncomfortable seeing other Spider-Man (men) being so nonchalant to Miles's father's possible, or to say destined death. I don't know if that's ok or something in its original comic books...? But I, originally, thought Spider-Man should at least be a good person and should not take this, death of another person, so granted. I thought at least most of them should feel something but in the movie, nah.Please don't take this the wrong way but I feel like I can almost sense how the movie is drafted. You have a scene where Gwen and Miles are sitting together looking at the beautiful city upside down. You have another scene where several spidermen flying in wild, chaotic and beautiful Mumbai. Now how you make that happen?But anyway it is a movie that deserves to be watched in a theatre. The visual effects are wild and wonderful and I don't think any other movies this year can beat. I don't actually feel bad for the movie being just 'a half' (maybe?) but next time maybe work a little bit more on the characters (and plots), okay? If that helps.",positive
650,"Okay I know that's stupid to say but give me your time and I'll make a reason to why I think this way.Action: Spiderman wins
No doubt, Spider-Man has way better action and much more of it compared to Madam Web. Which one wins? Depends on taste: real vs animation. I believe Spider-man does ultimately win this.Acting: Spiderman wins
Voice acting for Spider-man is good and when you consider the parental and friend dynamics are testing at the seems... everyone does a great job. As for Madam Web, the villain was bad with his acting easily and the other 3 girls feel a little off with Dakota being the better of all them and that isn't saying too much. So, Spiderman wins this.Cinematography: Madam Web
Both have a variety of shot sizes, angles and movements but it's the in-camera work of Madam Web that impresses. You could look at animation and forget that they can have whatever shots they want compared to real life; it's harder to get those amazing movements. Madam web has that and all you have to do is look at the diner scene on YouTube when the villain is on the roof, super cool.Music: Spiderman Wins
The music or score ultimately is better with Spiderman than madam web. Sure, there are 2000s favourites but Spiderman has always had a great track record of selecting great tracks to put in and that remains consistent here.Story: Madam Web wins
This is the fundamental part of any film: a great story with a 3-act structure that has an ending that is so fulfilling that it has the right to tease sequels. In the case of Spiderman, no: it does not.Story cons with Spiderman
1) Poorly characterised villain even though they try to make him meaningful but it comes off as a failure
2) Ends with no resolutions
3) Mile's doesn't learn anything, rather it's implied more so and he doesn't actually use that to act differently: maybe in the next movie.Story comes with Madam Web
1) Villian can feel cookie cutter but for a simple villian who looks epic it does the job and seeing basically an evil Spiderman was awesome!2) 3 girls are supposed to be spider-women from the trailer but actually not. The trailer lied while the movie does use the scenes effectively to tell the story: its madam web's story so it makes sense.3) The ending death was funny, earned but just lazy writing and could've been better.A movie with 2/10 is really close to the level that this movie is and yet the review scores are the polar opposite.Ultimately, this movie is very good but not amazing or perfect.",neutral
651,"The featured IMDb review as I'm writing this describes Across the Spider-Verse as a ""visual concert"" and I have to agree. There really isn't a better way to articulate how incredibly beautiful this film is. There are so many different art styles in the movie. They should all clash with one another and the fast pace of the narrative is such a chaotic catalyst to manage, but it still works so well. In isolation, every scene and style is gorgeous, from the emotional washed out watercolor of Spider-Gwen's moments with her dad to the loud bombastic entrances of Spider-Punk, or the busy, charismatic styles of Spider-Man India. They're all woven together in a complimentary way, edited with cuts, zooms that keep the screen dynamic, that keep you on the knifes edge between taking it all in and being overwhelmed. It's a balance that seeds a desire in me to watch this movie over and over again just so I can soak in every pixel of detail. Avatar (2009) was lauded for it's visual appeal, but Across the Spider-Verse is really where eye-candy is at. Apples to oranges? Maybe, but that's really how I feel about how incredible this movie looks.It doesn't stop there though, this movie is equally as mindful of your ears and delivers an ensemble of punchy songs, soundtracks, musical motifs to truly complement the moving painting that this movie is. There are swelling orchestral pieces, spirited hip hop tracks, snazzy electronic snippets, and the chilling synth motifs that were iconic in the first installment. If you were blind or if you were deaf, there still would not be a dull moment, as either side of the equation is tuned to perfection, but together, it's just something ethereal.I really cannot believe there's more. The story is so good. It's well written, it's genuine. We're brought along for the ride as Miles navigates his responsibilities and follow as he stretches himself thin constantly trying to have his cake and eat it too, the central theme for the many conflicts this film sets up. Then there are subplots, there are cliches, and neither overstay their welcome. We have romantic tension, jealously, friendship, betrayal, action, loss, sacrifice. All woven into the beautiful web of a story and so well paced. It's a fast moving movie but you don't feel rushed.There are new characters, we're reunited with familiar faces as well. But everyone in the movie is as compelling as the next. Spot, a villain we're set up to underestimate overdelivering in the best ways as he matures into his powers. Spider-Man 2099 giving us everything we want to see in a antagonist who's ultimately doing what he does in pursuit of well-intentioned utilitarianism. Spider-Man India who's steals the show every time he's on screen. Pregnant Spider-Woman, who I didn't even know was a variant I'd love to see. Miles, Spider-Gwen, Peter B. Parker, all the others as great as they were in the first movie. Oh and the voice acting. Oscar Isaac as 2099 especially. Incredible. I'm excited to hear more of Jharrel Jerome as Earth #42 Miles Morales as well.Unlike the first movie, Across the Spider-Verse is a Part One (of presumably two?). While the movie is clinically perfect in what it delivers, there isn't any resolution so it isn't the entire story. I'll fully acknowledge that setting up problems is much easier to write than the solutions for those problems are, but this film has done an absolutely incredible job setting up a promising showdown. We've got Miles struggling to juggle his double life as Spider-Man, his desire to save his dad at the risk of destroying his entire universe, the guilt of knowing he exists at the cost of his universe's Peter Parker and he is, by extension, the reason Earth #42's exists without a Spider-Man., then the very real manifestation of those same consequences in Earth #42 Miles Morales as the Prowler, the manhunt lead by Spider-Man 2099, and his own continued hunt for Spot. Miles won't face on these challenges alone, but even with help of the full Spider-crew accumulated across these two masterful films, writing, directing, producing, and animating a third act worthy of the first two is going to be a monumental creative endeavor. If the geniuses behind this epic can pull it off, and I have every confidence that they can, we may well be looking at the greatest superhero trilogy ever to grace cinema.",positive
652,"From the moment the film begins, you immediately know you're in for something special. There were no lulls, no moments you could use the restroom or refill your popcorn, because every single moment counted and made you want to pay attention.The visuals were completely stunning the entire way through. The attention to detail and stylistic difference between universes and the dwellers within them were nothing short of astonishing.Unsurprisingly for anybody who has seen the first installment of the series, the score for this sequel is incredible. It does a fantastic job of setting not only the tone of each scene, but each moment within a scene. There is no doubt that the opening scenes would not be nearly as enthralling if not for the music that accompanied them.Every fan of any Spider-Man will find something to love about this film, but more than that, Across The Spider-Verse is full of moments that will appeal to audiences regardless of if you're a superhero fan at all. The characters have authentic struggles and feelings that will connect with people of all backgrounds, ages, and lifestyles.I can without a doubt say that Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse deserves every award it's eligible for when award season rolls around. It's heartfelt, impactful, exciting, humorous, hopeful, defiant, and an all-around beautifully written story with equally beautiful visuals, acting, and music.Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse swings into theaters on March 29th, 2024.",positive
653,"Alright, let's talk about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse! I finally got to watch it, and boy, it was AMAZING! This movie took Spider-Man to a whole new level, and I think it's one of the best animated films ever made.The animation was out of this world! They blended different art styles together, and it looked absolutely stunning. Every scene was bursting with colors and attention to detail, making it a visual treat.The story was a wild ride! They took us on this epic adventure through multiple universes, and I was hooked from start to finish. The new Spider-characters they introduced were so cool, and it was awesome to see their different personalities and powers.The voice acting was top-notch! Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, and the older Peter Parker were all brilliantly portrayed, bringing life to their characters and making them feel relatable.The movie's soundtrack was on point! It added a whole new layer of excitement and emotion to the scenes, making it even more immersive.And the action scenes, oh my goodness! They were absolutely mind-blowing. The choreography and visuals were incredible, and it felt like I was swinging right alongside Spidey.But it wasn't all about the action; there were heartfelt moments too. The movie had some great themes about friendship, perseverance, and self-discovery, which really resonated with me.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for any Spider-Man fan and anyone who loves a good superhero flick. It's packed with jaw-dropping animation, an engaging story, and a lot of heart. I can't wait for the next installment! Solid ten stars from me!",positive
654,"This movie pushes the envelope in storytelling and animation. You don't need to watch the first movie to understand everything, but it helps! Gwen's storyline won me over this time. The marriage of soundtrack and animation is so smooth. It made me think about family, and the struggles of growing up and how it changes your relationships over time. The movie hits on themes of belonging and community, and going against the grain to stay true to your beliefs. I'd say the first movie is about courage in the face of adversity, and this one builds upon that by emphasizing conviction and loyalty. I love this movie.",positive
655,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse continues with the adventures of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore), after the events of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). Miles swings across the Multiverse, where he meets a huge team of Spider-People charged with safeguarding it. When all these various heroes disagree on how to handle a new sinister villain, Miles must dig deep & reinvent what it means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers & Justin K. Thompson have given us a movie that not only matches up to the masterpiece that is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018), but somehow manages to surpass it. The multiple Easter eggs referencing Spidey's appearances in various forms of media over the years, is absolutely delightful to witness. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. There are many scenes that will make you guffaw uncontrollably. There are many emotional scenes that will tug at your heartstrings & will make you tear up, too. All in all, the perfect ingredients that gives the viewers the best Spider-Man film of all time, even surpassing the superlative Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). The animation is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Kudos to the animators for continually pushing the envelope in the Spider-Verse franchise. The vocal performances are the highlight of the movie. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Hailee Steinfeld is outstanding as Gwen Stacy. Brian Tyree Henry is phenomenal as Jeff Morales. Luna Lauren Velez is amazing as Rio Morales. Jake Johnson is awesome as Peter B. Parker. Oscar Isaac is fantastic as Miguel O'Hara. Jason Schwartzman is brilliant as Spot. Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya, Karan Soni & Shea Whigham are excellent as Jessica Drew, Hobie Brown, Pavitr Prabhakar & George Stacy, respectively. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must watch for Spidey fans & pretty much everyone else. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Eagerly waiting with bated breath for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse(2024)!",positive
656,I don't know how much you know spider-man but what I learned about spider-man is that he is the most helpless and unlucky person but what makes him so special to me is the drama and problems that he has. In this movie and the last spider-man movie ( No Way Home ) they focus on the pain and suffering of the character through the years of his work and that's so meaningful because what makes spider-man a relatable character is the story and the events that changes his life and they mention those events with so much pain that you experience those pains again and again in your head and you wonder why the man is so helpless and in that moment you have a very straight connection with the character because all those pains and story lines that you experienced and broke your heart is the strong connection that you have with the character.This movie highlight those pains and with a serious tone in an animation tells you that BEING SPIDER-MAN IS A SACRIFICE.,neutral
657,The film started off 10 stars I loved the comic feel it gives just like the first one it's funny and serious at the same time which I love the villion the spot was funny at the start but as the film went on he got more evil and evil I loved the new spider people that got introduced not better than the spider people in the first movie but still funny.The ending is the bad part for me and what sets it back 4 stars the chase scene felt like it was going on for hours and it was unnecessary to be that spreaded out the plot twist was confusing as well and just when I finally understood it said to be continued hopefully the third one tops this.,neutral
658,"A comic-book superhero movie like Across the Spider-Verse will be a blast on the big screen if you're hungry for an animated spectacle, but not all visual treats tell pacy stories that are able to keep up. Don't get it wrong; that's not to say that the film doesn't have a plot with a clear amount of ideas and effort in it, especially with the parental themes. Just don't expect as much fun and excitement as you saw in the predecessor, so you'll come out feeling pretty satisfactory about it, or you might still even be pleasantly surprised. It's all subjective, and that's always to keep in mind.The real problem that takes place within some films like Across the Spider-Verse, and note that this is completely varied across different opinions, but it's that their runtimes overstay their welcomes and yet still are very incomplete movies with draggy sections. Some moviegoers will be captivated by the animation alone, but there are so many scenes that could've been cut without affecting the story. It's understandable that most action movies need those slower scenes to give the audience time to breathe (slow scenes are not the equivalent of dialogue scenes), but this movie just has too much breathing time to offer.The major presence of this common flaw that isn't limited to just the action movie genre is really the film's only issue. In reality, a lot of people who found the film to be boring might still agree that the story was completely worthy. The voice performances are somewhere in between greater and usual for animated movie standards, and the writing is also very good. As said though, a reason this overrated movie receives big numbers is the animation. What hasn't been said and what haven't you heard? It's a beautiful combination of traditional 2D animation and 3D computer work.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",positive
659,"Without fail, I have watched wildly successful movies gain sequels that were too big for just one movie. The latest entry in this Trilogy Conundrum is none other than the animated Spider-Verse series. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) was a stylish and refreshing animated film that won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Its sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), is equally good in both storytelling and animation. However, the size of such a story being stretched over two films affected some of this movie's pacing.I am increasingly becoming a fan of the ""stylized"" animated movies like Into the Spider-Verse and Across the Spider-Verse. Pixar can show how realistic CGI animation can be, but I found truly creative CGI animation in other studios like this one. This ""cartoony"" style lends itself to the humor of the fight between Miles (Shameik Moore) and Spot (Jason Schwartzman). It's also versatile enough to be serious when it needs to be. If anything, it is able to highlight the visual differences between the different universes.Superfans of the Spider-Man franchise likely got tons of references from decades of Spider-Man iterations. Even if this is your first introduction to the character, it's likely you already know about the ""canon events"" that make up the central theme of this movie. Although it was enjoyable to see Spider-Man in different settings, the film's second half was sluggish as it built up to the next movie's premise. Not knowing where they were going to cut to a ""To Be Continued"" card made the last bit seem endless. Still, I'm excited to watch the last part of this trilogy since the first two parts have been solid.A solid Trilogy Conundrum entry in the Spider-Verse saga, I give Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 4.5 stars out of 5.",positive
660,"This animated trilogy has a very definitive style which is incredible to the eye. But also exceptionally distracting. So much is going on that it becomes a blur. And for a lot of people with attention span deficit can attest, even this was too much.Sickening messages of fraud fleecers Black Lives Matter, or the Trans agenda pepper the background, this message isn't entirely stapled to the message in front of us. Which is still a bit foggy. What is Miles into. Here he exists in one dimension whilst his love interest Gwen Stacy, exists in another. When there is a ripple in the multiverse, a group of Spider-folk band together to police the time and space portals.As with ""The Flash"" trying to re-do tragedy in your life has consequences. In Miles' case, he bears the responsibility of all the Spider-folk storyline. That someone in his life that he loves dearly will need to die. The suffering creates who he is. As in previous story lines, Uncle Ben is killed to set Peter Parker into hero mode. Here, Miles' Pop will need to be the universe's sacrifice. Will he allow that happen? Meh. The visuals are eyepopping.What really irks me, is what I've been writing here for the last superhero movies. MAKE A DAMN COMPLETE movie. Here is the middle part of a trilogy. WHY must it have a ""to be continued"" I vomited in my Goobers on this one. This is lazy story telling. However, I will give them this...it makes sense in comic book world...I suppose.In this ending, Miles is stuck in an alternate reality that doesn't have a Spiderman but does have a villain. It is Miles himself.",positive
661,"Went to see this in IMAX with a good feeling and a small hype (after seeing reviews). Didn't watch any trailers before as well. The movie starts extremely slowly. We were 30 minutes in and finally we get a intro scene. I finally start to get more excited and I hope for the best. No... The animation looks weird. The style had changed from the original and it just doesn't reach prequels levels (at any point). The story still doesn't begin. Nothing happens and we see Morales' new enemy who just doesn't fit to the movie at all. Well, still hoping for the best as I watch clock on my wrist... 30 minutes left and finally we are getting the story kicked but I knew it wasn't going to reach to the end now... And it didn't.Instead of a movie, we got ourselves a +2 hours long teaser for the actual movie. What a bummer.Audience at my theater sat silently the whole movie. Only few laughs for few jokes, but oh boy it was awkward. The theater director got more applauds when she introduced us to IMAX cinema and told us to take care of own trashes, than what the movie did when it ended. When the movie ended I only heard negative comments: 1. Finally... 2. There had been better spiderman movies. 3. *a big sigh and frustration.Also no post credit? So many kids got mad when they sat for the whole credits.In summary, I really liked when the movie started, but... This could've been in one part... Feels like the writer didn't know what he wanted and just wanted to include everything and now we need 2 parts (at least) to get it over. So 0 stars for the first halve of the movie and 10/10 for the ending. So that's 5/10.",positive

I don't want to spoil too much, but i would recommend this movie to all.",neutral

The Movie ist very Good. The first film was already very good but it is perfect this film is destined for more than just the Oscar for the best animated film of the year I also found the characters all very great they all got a good role in the film I was often surprised how actually the movie is good.",positive
664,"Spider-man: Across the Spiderverse is an impressive piece of pop art entertainment, with its infinite visuals and creative spin on the now-popular multiverse narrative.This sequel easily surpasses its predecessor and towers high above this year's comic book films and animated films. At times, you wonder why the current live-action comic book movies aren't as intelligently crafted.Amidst the grand scale of all things multiverse and that which comes with, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and Dave Callaham's script stay true to being a character piece for the Miles Morales character that's in-keeping with all the best Spider-man stories: a coming of age story about responsibility.There's a shorthand brilliantly at play. Since most of the characters are variations of Spider-man, the script handles its supporting characters in a nonchalant throwaway manner and never gets stuck into the downward spiral of world-building, fan service, or meta-humor.The animation is gorgeous and I loved the combination of different art styles as a storytelling device. It instantly communicates a sense of geography and period setting. For example, there's a villain is drawn in the style of Leonardo Da Vinci's charcoal sketches.However, at 2 hours and 20-minutes, Across the Spiderverse does offer too much of a good thing. With its quick editing, rapid dialogue, and multiple styles of animation moving at a breakneck pace, it does get hard to keep up with it for such a long time.Full disclosure: I nodded off during the finale of the first film and completely missed the Kingpin showdown from overstimulation. Admittedly, Across the Spiderverse does a better job than the first film by pacing quieter moments in between the set pieces.Narratively speaking, I wish the filmmakers flat out announced that this film was going to be the first of a two-part storyline. The upcoming Mission Impossible movie is very clear about this in its title.I was waiting for the story to wrap up until I figured it out it was going to be a cliffhanger. It would have made a world of difference.",positive
665,"After watching the first instalment, i had very high expectations for the second movie, and it truly delivers on all aspects, highly entertaining from start to finish. The characters have a very strong presence and meaning to the storyline with plenty of action sequences along with a great soundtrack of which makes the movie even more enjoyable. I personally think this is the greatest animated movie I've ever seen and for sure the best Spider-Man movie that's ever been for sure ,well just go to the cinema and judge for yourself you will not be disappointed. 9.1 metre score on IMDb it should be more !",positive
666,"I love this movie! I love to see so many spider people, i love how they explain the multiverse. Imho, the story is a bit dragging however it might be this way to set up the second one next year. I don't mind to sit for 2 hours in the cinema and i enjoy every second of it. I love the artstyle.. seriously! Lately, with all the boring movie from disn*y and the gloomy theme they choose, this one feels like a fresh air. At least to me. So beautifully drawn, so colorful and yeah.. even when some part of it can be bit boring, i still can't keep my eyes off this movie. It's worth to watch. I am hoping to watch it again next year in the cinema. It's worth every penny.",positive
667,"This movie exceeded all my expectations. The only bad thing about this movie is that it ends. I am going to be optimistic and hope that part 2 will be released in a year as promised but I am not sure that will be the case. The animation, the colors, the visuals, the characters and dialogues. Everything is masterful and it deserves its runtime of 2+ hours. I could've watched 10 hours of this story without ever being bored. The soundtrack is incredible as expected. Miguels theme is very futuristic sounding and is similar to the prowlers theme in texture. I could tell what kind of character it would be just by the first seconds of seeing him and hearing his music. The spots theme is incredibly haunting and conveys the emotions of dread and void amazingiy.",neutral
668,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings into theaters with a mix of excitement and anticipation. While the film boasts a good villain and the confidence of its directors for what lies ahead, the overall story falls short of its potential, resulting in a movie that is just ""okay"" without offering anything truly groundbreaking.One of the film's standout aspects is undoubtedly its villain. The character's portrayal and development add depth to the narrative, injecting a sense of urgency and raising the stakes for our beloved web-slinger. Their presence serves as a strong driving force throughout the movie, capturing the attention and curiosity of the audience.However, where Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse struggles is in the execution of its story. While the film doesn't necessarily disappoint, it fails to deliver that extra layer of complexity and emotional resonance that made its predecessor so memorable. The narrative feels somewhat predictable and lacks the innovative spark that made the original Spider-Verse such a groundbreaking film.Despite these shortcomings, one cannot help but acknowledge the confidence exuded by the directors. It is clear that they have a firm grasp on the larger universe they are building and have exciting plans for future installments. This confidence shines through in the film's visual style, animation, and attention to detail, reminding audiences that there are greater things to come.In conclusion, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse offers a mixed experience. While the movie falls short in terms of its story, the inclusion of a compelling villain and the evident directorial confidence regarding the franchise's future provide a glimmer of hope. Fans of the Spider-Verse and its unique animation style will find enough enjoyment to warrant a watch, but it falls short of achieving the greatness of its predecessor.",positive
669,"I've never bothered to go as far as to write a review for a movie I've seen but rating this a 10 honestly doesn't do it enough justice. This movie is easily the best superhero movie and in general one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes everything that we loved about the first movie and completely expands on it. Nothing about the movie feels recycled or redundant. Everything about this movie from the animation, characters, plot is so refreshing. I've enjoyed plenty of movies in my life but I haven't been this exciting to talk about a movie. The pacing is perfect and I love how they set up the next movie. I hope the quality remains the same for the 3rd installment. The wait for this movie was 100% worth it!",positive
670,"Last year I saw Into the spiderverse and was stunned by its unique art style and greatness.Arguably it was the best adaptation of the beloved Spider-Man comics, considering its tremendous love for detail and easter eggs.So the expectations for this sequel were immense.They needed only 10 minutes to fulfill them.Across the spider verse not only manages to keep all the magic the predecessor created, it expands on it and improves in every single possible way. This is an achievement rarely seen in entertainment history and therefore deserves my respect. Soundtrack is perfect, it is emotional were it has to be emotional, it is epic when it needs to be epic and its entertaining over the full 140 minutes. Writing is top class, I immediately cared for the characters, plottwist are greatly set.Animation is this movie's biggest strength. Never I have seen quality like that. Even with 5 years in between no other company could copy that, this speaks for itself.In times in which superhero movies are far away from their former glory, Marvel and DC struggeling to make profit, Sony pulls all the right triggers, relinquishing on pushing political agendas, and creating an outstanding piece of art, beloved by fans and critics.Because of movies like these we go to the cinemas.Hands off, this was special, by far the best film of 2023 so far. I cannot await to see the sequel next year!And please give us a scene with Miles and Gwen kissing. This HAS to happen.",positive
671,"This was disappointing on two fronts. First because I loved the first movie. Second because the imdb rating was so high. In fact, I'm only reviewing it here to help restore order to the universe. Something seems fishy about the exceedingly high rating it currently enjoys...The animation is still great, though at times overwrought and feels self indulgent. Which highlights probably the big issue with this whole movie - the editing, or lack thereof.There's enough story here for maybe 30 minutes at most. So many scenes dragged on way too long. Script is pretty abysmal, about 1 out of every 20 jokes lands, and the remainder generate varying levels of cringe.It feels like the creators focused all their talent and energy on the visuals, as if it'd make up for the poor script and storytelling.If you're over 16 and not a superfan, you'll be bored to tears.Since watching it, I've yet to find anyone who really liked it. Again, its current rating seems highly suspicious....",positive
672,"Across the Spiderverse exceeded my expectations. Making Miles and Gwen the leads was the right choice as we got to see more of Gwens backstory and Miles's struggle with hiding his identity from his parents. The Return of Peter. B was great and this time he has a child with MJ, which was a big middle finger to the comics and I'm all there for it. The references and cameos were insane, the voice acting was top notch and the animation miraculously exceeded that of the first one. The route the writers went down with Spider-Man 2099 and Spider-Woman was great, but instead of making Spot a joke for the entirety of the movie, they made him a scary multiversal threat with a vendetta against Miles. The overall plot was great and I can't wait for Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse to release next year.",positive

674,"In this first part of the sequel of Â¨SpiderMan Into The SpiderVerseÂ¨ i think they introduce really good the new characters and take some details and parts of the background history of every new character from the respective comics and they do it right because they respect the main ideas of the comics, so the espectators that are casual can understand more o less how is the orignial comic and for the fans that had already read the comics they can appreciate the details and the endeavor that the animators, writers, directors, and producers put in the movie, because it isn't a movie creacted just for usually lectors of comics is also a movie to casual espectators.",positive

676,"I went to watch the Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse I slept on it the thing I hated about it was the ""TO BE CONTINUED"" IM JUST KIDDING THIS MOVIE WAS ......WAS GREAT the animation,the characters,F! CKING VILLIAN MILES!? I mean PROWDER the thing I really like about this movie is Miguel o Hara he was such a great villian/hero. I felt like this movie really needed him and yeah he was so hot. By the way Miles is the best Spider-Man if I see people disliking and making slander post I'm going to send them to a mental hospital because there is no way that you hate miles.So that's all I had to say this movie is a masterpiece ii think it will get 9/10 if it didn't have the cliffhanger!",positive
677,"""Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go. Sorry, I'm doing my own thing.""
Miles MoralesTo every Spider-Man fan. Every single one who has ever loved one of the comic books, an animated episode, a video game, or a motion picture to come out from Marvel and Sony studios. This film is a love letter to you. And it's a hella beautiful one.Animated with a blast in an array of colors, style, and personality, this is a hyper-stimulating, visual candy feast for the eyes. It's as if you could almost simply reach out to the screen and feel the sheer brilliance, creativity, and love that was behind the making of it at your very fingertips. With every frame, cut, and transition, the screen oozes with cinematic charisma on a revolutionary level for animated films.The action sequences bombard you, the intimate moments hit you hard in the gut, the dialogue is delivered with such authenticity and hilarity, the cinematography is vibrantly crisp with diverse textures, lights and shadows, and the soundtrack elevates and brings everything to life with it's instant magnetism. All components come together so harmoniously smooth with a bewitching, artistic beauty to transcend you in such a miraculous way very few films have succeeded in doing until all that remains to exist are your pair of eyes glued to the screen with no bone in your body willing to look away for even a second.Touching on self-sacrifice, family, responsibility, fate and what it would mean if you had the chance to confront yours and change it. What makes us who we are if all the things that happened to us never happened? Who would you end up as if you weren't given the life you're currently living in? Are we mere products of our past whose fate has already been fabricated by some unknown universal law, like a marionette manipulated by a web of strings of our pre-determined future? ""Across the Spider-Verse"" take these questions, twists them within this multiversal world of Spider-Men, and ask us: What if we had a say in all this?Amidst all the chaos, there's a heart-felt story about a guy battling abandonment, loss, and isolation, whose existence originated from a single universal mistake. A guy who has been kept in the dark for too long and is threatened to play a passive role in order for certain life events to unfold by themselves. But no matter how many times he is beaten down he rises up to fight another battle, to do what he believes is right even when what's righteous has now been clouded by ambiguity and uncertainty.What a masterful Spider-Man film to witness on the big screen and one surely the rest of the massive collective of passionate fans will love.",positive
678,"I for one loved the soundtrack and animations. The color shifts with emotion in such a beautiful way. Also loved the funny Spider-Man moments. Spots a funny character too the ATM scene really kept my attention.On the other hand;
I felt at one point like ""god how long is this movie?!"" Cause it felt like it was dragging on with no real progress. Lots of unanswered questions. Is spot the big bad guy? Is the vampire spider man a secret villain or insane? Is alternate Myles the bad guy?! I don't know and once we got a ""team"" together it just ended. Glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters. My daughter was so confused on why it ended mid movie.Will I watch the next one? Yes.Will I pay? No, I'll wait for Netflix.",positive
679,"It's been a long, long time since I've been so happy with what I've seen in theaters. Honestly, I doubt I'll ever see anything like this again.The cinematography of this masterpiece seemed to be something surreal. Something that could never be reproduced. But was. And how it was.The story was fantastic. Everything connected, naturally. Nothing was ""pulled"" by the script. On the contrary, everything seemed to fall into place. A unique experience, no doubt.When the movie ended, I was shocked. Two hours that felt like ten minutes. The social relationships, the punctual humor and all the analogies/references made this sequence semi-perfect. 10/10.",positive
680,"Where to begin? This is a much better movie overall than the first one, which I honestly wasn't super impressed with. The overall pacing and story are much stronger. The animation is more innovative. The fun ""street"" culture aspects of the first film are still present, although slightly toned down. One of my favorite aspects is the fact that the villain, at face value, doesn't seem very menacing, which is a breath of fresh air in the superhero movie genre. However, the whole ""multiverse"" aspect feels canned, especially after watching Spiderman: No Way Home, which has a very similar premise to this movie.Across the Spiderverse picks up where the first one leaves off. More importance is given to Gwen's narrative this time around. Gwen, amidst a turbulent relationship with her father, becomes a member of the Spider Society, which is an interdimensional secret society of Spider people led by futuristic Spider-man 2099, AKA Miguel. She then enters Miles' dimension, who is having problems with hiding his secret identity as Spiderman from his parents, to recruit him to join the Spider Society.Without going too much into spoilers, I am pretty confused as to why the Spider Society exists and as to how the laws of space and time apply to it. Does it exist outside of space and time? Otherwise, how would Spider-man 2099 be there? Or did he travel back in time?I am not a big fan of the whole concept of the Spider Society. Miles coming to the Spider Society for the first time feels almost like a rip off of Harry Potter when he first comes to Hogwarts. It's this whole notion of ""you thought you were the only one, but there are actually a ton of others just like you."" It almost feels like the antithesis of the Tigger Movie, where, as opposed to realizing his true family is Pooh and the gang, Tigger at long last finds his Tigger family.What the heck are all these spider people doing to prevent the multiverse from collapsing? Hasn't Spider-man 2099 heard that too many cooks spoil the broth? I would think the fact that they are not in their own respective dimensions fighting crime would cause problems for the multiverse. Do we really expect these spider people to be able to balance being a hero in their own dimension, being a hero in other dimensions, their personal lives, and hanging out at this fancy schmancy Spider Society headquarters in their spare time? Where does the Spider Society's funding come from?I'm really not a fan of the music chosen for this movie either. None of the songs feel meaningful. They use songs that are hip or maybe sound cool to kids at the cost of being ephemeral. The score could have been much stronger. This is the one area of the movie that was perhaps a step backward from the first one. Also, in a few scenes product placement is blatantly obvious, but we can let that slide.It feels like they cram too many characters into this movie, just like in the first one. We are introduced to an Indian Spiderman and a punk rock Spiderman (Spiderpunk), neither of whom are explored very thoroughly. Au contraire, they both come off as rather flat. They serve more as eye candy than actual characters pertinent to the overarching plot, which is a real shame.This is not to say I dislike the film. The animation is truly spectacular, although at times it feels as if you're watching a 3-D movie without the glasses. I understand this is the aesthetic they are going for to immerse us in a cinematic comic book world, but I find it annoying and distracting. The use of split-screen animation to portray multiple locations at once to recreate the experience of reading comics is a cool effect, although I feel they could have done more with this. As mentioned in the introduction, the main villain, The Spot, is a unique and refreshing antagonist (although they definitely borrowed the character design from Alan Moore's Watchmen).There is also depth to this movie when it comes to portraying Miles and Gwen's relationships with their respective parents. These are the most heartwarming scenes of the movie. They really hit the nail on the head in capturing the teenage angst and sense of rebellion of the two young protagonists, who love their parents but want to protect them at the cost of having to lie to them about their powers. Although this is somewhat of a clichÃ© by now in the superhero genre, here it comes across as sincere and authentic.Overall, I wouldn't call this an amazing movie. Nor would I call it mediocre at best. It certainly has accomplished more than its predecessor, especially in terms of pacing and animation. It is to be applauded for breaking the mold of the stereotypical superhero movie. However, the whole interdimensional travel trope is too convenient and not very creative. But, in addition to the stunning visuals, this is a movie with heart. I certainly wouldn't mind watching it again.",positive
681,"People way overhyped this one. I was told by multiple people, including a coworker who said I would enjoy it after watching the first one. The first one is one of my all time favorites. This one just felt like filler, which is aweful considering how much the first one was able to accomplish. I know this is a part one, but it felt like just noise for two and a half hours. It was a clear step back from the first one, which still remains a 10 for me. It felt like it was trying to tell three stories at once and not executing all of them well. The ending was also a bit let down. Once the movie picked up steam it completely dropped the ball. I can only hope the finale fixes these mistakes.",neutral
682,"I didn't think anything could possibly top the first film since it set the bar so high for superhero movies going forward. Tbh I wasn't expecting the sequel to be on the same level as the first one but boy was I proven wrong. Across The Spider Verse is Brilliant!!! The animation is phenomenal and every single frame is so overwhelmingly gorgeous. The story is pretty well written and the way it manages to combine it's emotional and humours moments with the insanity of the Multiverse and the themes of family and friendship so flawlessly is mind-blowing. The stakes are always high which is made even more intense by the musical score. The action is simply fantastic. Every shot of it and the way it's been choreographed keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. The new characters they introduced are all amazing with their fierce character designs. Gwen's backstory works perfectly with the story and the struggle she's facing. The romantic tension between Miles and Gwen felt really cute which is only elevated by the top notch voice acting. However some of the snippets of the other Spider Man films kinda felt a little off to me at times.This isn't just some superhero kids movie. It's easily the best Spider Man movie in years and one of the best films I've ever seen. It is more intense, dark, and mature with jaw dropping action and out of this world animation that is made to be seen on the big screen.",positive
683,"2 hours Spider-Man movie doesn't disappoint. Lovely graphics and developed story. A successful sequel to into the spider verse. A spin-off of Spider-Man is wonderful and I am excited for the third movie in 2024. Also humorous and funny, deep story and great ideas would definitely recommend it.Only cons our long chase scenes and some bits that are just too developed and goofy. Flashing lights throughout the movie made it vibrant and unlike most average movies. The comic graphics style is wonderful and I hope when the third movie comes out, it will be similar, or even better, if that's possible (I hope they kiss).",positive
684,"What can I say about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse that has not been said already? The movie is absolutely fantastic and the characters are amazing. Spider man India, spider man 2099, and spider punk really stand out as new comers to the franchise! Loved the different spider people and the cameos from beloved spider men from the past marvel projects. The animation is absolutely beautiful and I loved how they gave each universe its own unique look to it. The plot twist at the end was so good and very unexpected! This one really left you on a huge cliffhanger that gets you excited for Beyond the Spider verse.",positive
685,"I wasn't even a Spider-Man fan, but I guess I am now. This movie absolutely blew my mind. Watching it in a movie theater felt like ascending into another universe. The soundtrack, the animation, the atmosphere and the vibe... Everything was went hand in hand with the story. The characters.are not flat, rather deep. The colors, the artstyle, the humor... Truly a masterpiece, I'm not even exaggerating. I'm just still in shock because the quality of this film caught me off-guard. And also, Gwen Stacy is surprisingly attractive and yes, I can say that, I'm 16 years old. Speaking of, I think this movie is suitable for many different ages. Even if you're, like, 60 years old, you would probably enjoy this movie. I totally recommend it.",positive
686,"When you release a movie that not only makes a ton of money for the production company / movie makers and everyone else to then have a massive fan base and all round brilliant reviews the pressure is on to live up to the expectation...Well this new chapter... Basically.. Does!Once again, all returning spidey characters are back and a whole lot more in the many various Multi-verse settings all with its different tone and feels with loads more saturated colour and very vivid but a movie needs to be more than just look pretty this lives up to the first movie in an ambundance with a brilliant plot and a new bady - The Spot!I thorougly enjoyed, go see!",neutral
687,"The best superhero movie of the year!!! The animation is beautiful and has surpassed the animation and story as far as the first film goes. This is like Marvel's Empire strikes back and balances comedy, action and serious moments very well. You can agree with Miles and Miguel's side of what it means to be spider man and what it means to accept your sad fate. Oh yeah and the appearances of Tobey, Andrew and Spectacular spider-man were some of the best moments in the movie. I like that the romance between Miles and Gwen is not forced. Kudos and congratulations to everyone who worked on this film, the job was very well done!!!",positive
688,"I really shouldn't review this film, but I did see it. However, not only have I not seen its predecessor I haven't seen a Spider-Man movie since the second one with Tobey Maguire! Needless to say, films based on comic book characters are not my thing. This is very creative and an animated marvel that is entertaining in a lightweight sort of way until it eventually wears itself thin by its excessive length. I don't know how you evaluate voice acting, but everyone seemed good and the music helps a lot. Reading the reviews on this site this seems to be an extremely popular film so I'm sure many were very happy to see to be continued at the end, as though they needed that to know there would be more! Spider-Man and Batman seem to have an endless shelf life.",positive
689,"This move is an absolute masterpiece. An amazing plot with a couple of heart breaking revelations with the introduction of incredible new character. The movie definitely exceeded my expectations as first I thought they would make it a cameofest. Well there is actually a lot of cameos but they are the perfect amount and do not get in the way of the main objective of the movie. The animation style is even better the its predecessor with different unique types of animation spiced together with scenes using live action characters as well. Now more about the characters: They are as I said just incredible. The main villain Spot is amazing with a tragic backstory with an incredible arc of going through a goofy villain to an Avengers level threat is amazing. The other villain or even if you could call him one: Spider-Man 2099 is also really good. The characters motives aren't evil and also makes the audience root for him. Another character with a tragic backstory who just wants to protect his established order and prevent chaos in the multiverse even if it is hard for others to understand him. New secondary characters like Spider-punk,Spider-Man India and Spider Woman.They are also pretty enjoyable even tough they play more of a secondary character still doesn't make them any less great. Spider-punk's jokes and characteristics of being a rebel like spider-man to Spider-Man Indias funny lines and overall personality and finally Spider-Woman's loyalty to Spider-Man 2099 and her choice between good and bad are all amazing. Gwen Stacy takes the main spot light in the movie with her doing the intro of the movie and the first 20 minutes taking place in her universe. Her emotional scenes with his father with the watercolor background of her dimension and it changing with emotions are also just perfect. Now lets enter Miles. Miles has a long chunk of the movie with a 40 minute part dedicated to him in his home dimension. We get to see his personal life as a vigilante and his actual teenage life getting in the way and making him grow distant to his family perfectly captures the part teen and part super hero alter ego character. Better than any of the MCU movies with Peter Parker. The parts with Gwen and Miles emotionally hit so hard as well with the upside down tower scene being perfectly crafted to let us see his relationships direction with Gwen. Well the whole reason why Gwen comes to Miles is because of Spot and her spending time with Miles distracts her and Spot learns how to uses his spots to travel in the multiverse. So you can also see Spot's active work to get super powerful. The whole scenes in Spider-Man Indias dimension and Miles secretly following Gwen and her constant ignorance and harsh behavior toward Miles really builds up a twist thats about to happen. Then the whole spider-society scenes shows more about Miguel and his goals, Gwen's and Peter B Parker's betrayel and them working against Miles visually and emotionally is incredible with the entire spider-society chasing him as he needs to return to his own universe to save his father. To learn that he is actually never meant to be Spider-Man and everyone of his so called ""friends"" trying to stop him from going home. The two final acts of the movie include Gwen being kicked out of the spider-society and has to confront his father. For Miles he ends up going back with a machine in the spider society that sends him back to the wrong dimension (explaining that part would be too long). The movie ends with Miles confronting him self in the other dimension who turned into a vigilante that captured him and Gwen forming her own band after getting a dimensional watch from Hobie after he makes up with his father. So the movie end with a cliffhanger. Speaking of which now it is time to give my ONLY problem with the movie. A lack of conclusion. The movie sets the stage on whats coming next with Miles escaping and Gwen coming to rescue him. It sounds good on paper but it still ends it where there is no conclusion and maybe the movie could have ended with Spot killing his father and Miles wanting revenge on him (I know this sounds lame cause it is what they could have done is up to the directors). So yeah a more of a Avenger Infinity war type ending where Thanos wins. So a more fleshed out ending would be better. But the movie is for me a solid 9 out of 10.",positive
690,"The first hour of this movie was fantastic, crazy...even amazing! The characters were consistent like the first one, the story moved nicely and the animation, while way more frenetic than the first one, was engaging.The second hour, the movie starts to fold in on itself so much that it goes from ""cool references to all the weirdness that is Spider-Man"" to ""look how meta we are with this."" It becomes too much in my opinion. Additionally, the plot point that Miles is basically the most special of all Spider-Man's of all time when we spent 40 years in pop culture with another guy is so forced and strained. I don't like when a story becomes the story about the story, but that's what this movie did and it's a trap that might be its undoing.It's so tropey to have Miles be welcomed in by all the spider people and think he's found a home only to realize they're trying to trap him so the most special male figure in his life can die...so then what? He can have a canon event? Like what??? He's already freaking Spider-Man. Captain Stacy's death had less impact on him than Gwen's. I mean it doesn't even make sense. Gwen's dad retires in her universe, so she can still be spider Gwen?This is what happens when creators start focusing too much on the characters in the story and not the story the characters are in. Too bad, because the first movie is a solid 10. This one goes from a 9 in the first hour to a 5 in the second hour, so I averaged it out.Finally, I didn't pay $50 to see this movie with my family to have a corrupt hashtag ""covertly"" placed on the screen to stare at. It was so obvious and ""Buy Large Mansions"" should not have gotten any screen time in this movie.",positive
691,"The first movie was great, so I had high expectations if I am being honest. I am well versed in comics, and the mcu, fox, and sony movies. If you are interested in watching this movie, or someone you know is interested and you care about what you watch for the time being. I implore you to watch another movie. This is not for the people that care about a plot or the story. If I am being honest with you, there are so many branches of the story that you would need a story map to take tabs on what plot you are currently watching. This is a literal web of stories, and there are parts that are not kept together so well. If you are watching to matter socially, and you are not interested in the story whatsoever then by all means go ahead. Get your likes on whatever social media platform you use for watching. If you thought the last one was great, well this one is a sequel. With all due respect, this is not a good one. There are a few parts of the movie where there are no lines or actual storytelling. It's just them moving to a soundtrack for minutes. The art is phenomenal at some points in the movie, at some points it's fuzzy, blurry, or just garbage to be truthful. When this comes out on streaming or disc, it is not your device. It is the movie. The backgrounds for different universes are all different, and some are rushed to the point it looks like a bad tv screen idle loop. Some points are fantastic, and some are so bad I believe in the future people will make fun of us who said this movie was considered a movie. I don't mean to be harsh, but I feel like this movie had alterior motives. This is a review, so I will warn you that all the cameos are forced beyond recognition. If you have no clue who any of these characters are, then I guarantee you that you will not get many puns or memes during this. Its not jokes like comedy. They are cameos forced to try to fill in the role of being funny. Wow a character is in this movie. The entire audience reacts as if they are watching something interesting on their phone. I guess it is just not for me. This movie is for one kind of social group, and if you find this movie really interesting, very funny, heart poundingly good, and in any way a must watch again, movie of the year. You are one of that social group. I am not, and I know many people who are not that will find this a movie to take naps too or change. Save yourself some time if you have more important things to do. This is a 5 for me since I am a fan of the original content, and seeing some scenes that make some kind of point come to life made it a little worth watching.TL;DR: this movie is all over the place story and art wise. Stay away if this is not your cup of tea. If you watched this, who are the good guys? What was going on? What was even the point of anything? Where are we by the end of this movie strory-wise?",positive
692,"This movie is a well made movie with fantastic visuals and a great story, what really stands out is that the characters have a compelling narrative for being spider man especially between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, 2099 spider man and spot is a perfect example on how to have two villains in a movie without being a mess (Spider Man 3, The amazing spider man 2) the only problem I have with the movie is the cliffhanger because, SPOILERS, at the end we see the prowler, Miles Morales uncle being captured in another universe where his dad is already dead and we see another miles but as the prowler and the only issue I have is that I'm not one scene we don't see him acting or some sign of him being like his uncle which in my opinion would be stronger and more effective for the movie but overall 9.5/10.",positive
693,"This will contain spoilers!!! When i tell you, this film was the most gut wrenching, funny and beautiful film ever. I wasn't surprised that its a pt1 because in the second hour or so of the film it felt like it was dragging on and not going anywhere. I was waiting for it to all be resolved and it wasnt! I must say im gutted that we have to wait a year for pt2 but man.THE PLOT TWIST WAS INSANE! I knew from the start that miles was gonna end up in the wrong universe when he scanned his eye, but the suspense of waiting for it to be confirmed and the reveal of it! When gwen went into the bedroom to see it was empty!! WowI also LOVED, that in gwens universe the background reflects the mood of the scene, and when the watercolours were all mixung together and becoming muddy! It was so cool10/10.",positive
694,"I wasn't the biggest fan of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" - I mean I did enjoyed it but I found it a somewhat basic origin hero story (overplayed at this point) with outstanding animation.This... however is another whole story. Everything worked, from the animation that changed accordingly to the scenes (from pastels to neon to ultradetailed), the characters that felt much better developed and the story expertly deconstructed the whole origin and the mythos of superheroes.Even the cliffhanger felt earned, even though I wanted a proper resolution. The only nitpick I could have is the score and music which is just okay - but as I said it is just a nitpick.The only thing preventing me to give in it a 10 out of 10 is time - maybe after a few rewatches and how they develop the cliffhanger I could give a perfect score.I highly recommended it, even if you got superhero fatigue.",positive
695,"This movie was unbelievably amazing. There are very few people to whom I wouldn't recommend it. I went into the theater, not expecting it to surpass the first film. How wrong could I have been? This sequel improved upon so many aspects of the original, reflecting that the creators genuinely took audience feedback into account. My expectations were utterly surpassed; this is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a rare delight to find such an easy-to-watch, yet amazing movie - those two qualities often don't coexist. Even as someone who is notoriously picky about the movies I watch, this one gets my approval on all fronts. A great deal of events has happened since it's predecessor- one of my favorite movies of all time; this is even better.",positive
696,"'Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse' follows Miles Morales as he swings across the multiverse, in which he encounters a group of ""Spider-People"" charged with protecting its very existence. When the hero's disagree on how to handle a new threat. Miles must redefine what it means to be a hero.'Across The Spider-Verse' is one of the most thrilling, emotionally charged journeys I've witnessed in superhero storytelling. I think this sequel ups the game to its predecessor. One of the biggest standout elements to me is the difference in art/animation styles between the different universes. Each variation of Spider-Man comes from their own unique world with incredible visuals. You can really tell the film makers put their heart into this movie.One of my biggest praises for this movie is how well they handle the multiverse aspect. Over the last couple of years, the multiverse is an element that keeps popping up in film. But not all seem to do it right. THE STORY in this film is so well executed and has viewers captivated from start to finish. I really believe that's where the film shines most. As an additional feature, there are so many surprise cameos throughout the movie that I think Spider-Man fans will love and appreciate.I thoroughly enjoy every moment of this film, from its eye catching visuals, to its emotionally charged storytelling. Everything about this movie is incredible.",positive
697,"Action, funny moments,emotions and many other things made the film flow perfectly which allows the viewers to enjoy a good time. It contains the characteristic that the first one had which is great but the add of emotions in this movie is more visible and the way the director embedded different spider men without creating confusion is very remarkable in my opinion as it is not easy to put so many characters without ruining the experience. The only thing that made me ""angry"" was the ending as now I cannot wait for the next film. Let's wait for another year which I'm pretty sure it will be worth.",positive
698,"Contains spoilers
Spiderverse 2 was overall an interesting idea that felt rushed.You can watch the first movie but they only go off the first ine slightly and make a reference to it a few times which makes it seem somewhat like a sequel. The villain in this movie is consistently the funnies character and defintley has the audience entertained for a whole portion. The fact that hes funny does make him aharder to take seriously. And this movie seems to have a lot of coincidences when it comes to the villains involvement with the verious spidermen. In the beginning the female spiderman has the same situation as our spiderman in where her dad is a cop trying to figure out whos spiderman but spiderman seems like a bad guy to them. Anyways, her dad coincidentally finds her in a seemingly incriminating act and she just shrugs it off in her own tonal vocie. Her dad wouldve recognized her voice anyways. Then the scene has to end dramaticaly so she takes off her mask and he recognizes her, but she needs to be a part of the multiversal polic organiztion for her to be relevant in the plot so they arrive to help her basically and restrain her dad so she can go free. This is very rushed writing and also just isnt very interesting since the story can go anywhere now. The universe police association also get the ability to travel to other dimentions freely which completely guts the idea of not being able to go to another dimension.The scene where miles is teleporting away from the indian universe is inconsistent because the british spiderman never does yet he is not involved with the universe police association. Also their does not need to be 4 spidermans... they really dont do anything in the scene with the villain in the indian dimension. The british one is literally there to show britain and india are friends now given their past history. Is very rushed and the point of it is blatanlty oblivious yet not necessary. Also, if the villains goal is to kill spiderman bc he thinks he caused his accident, why didnt he just kill him right there when he had the chance in the india dimension. He enterss some portal to become more powerful? I dont think so. The beginning of movie is weak but middle and near the end is quite good. The music throughout the movie is poppin especially the samplles in nyc. Given all the praise and expectations the movie had, i think what it lacked in the beginning storywriting it made up for in action scenes and just overall competency with miles and gwen and the police association's involvement with eschother. I think this movie is quite good definetley good for teenagers as well as young adults. 6.5.",neutral
699,"On big aspect that stood out to us was all the spider-men displayed throughout the movie and the different perspectives and personalities on each spider-man. We also found that the visuals was what really made the film , although it was animated , the graphics really made it immersive for the viewers. However we wished that it was all in one part and not split into two , we get that it builds suspense for the following movie but we just would have liked for it to be all in one. In the event od us having to choose between real life Spiderman and animation , we would choose animation. This overall is a great movie and recommended to friends and family.",positive
700,"This movie is great. But it was a little too long at 140 minutes. The ending dragged.Great scenes, like the chase scene. Etc. Excellent cliffhanger. Not as good as the first one, but worked very hard to get an 8 at least, as all movies should, very impressed. Suprised, though you might need time to think about if this movie is great.It's already a financial hit, at least close to as well.The movie is very ambitoius as well. Much more so than the first one. Lot of Spidey-people. This movie has the bravery that no animated movie ever will again. WAY better than Disney's animated movies in the last year and a half. Better than even Luca, and I also really liked Luca.",positive

movie always loses. In this case the street

not about superficial appearance. That's
really the hidden moral of the story.The plot rests on the current fashion for
'multiverse"" themes. It's like a huge
tasteless meal that becomes impossible

The multiverse themes, the street art and

with a very infantile understanding of maths.",neutral
702,"I recently watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse and that was a great film, One of the best animated films ever made! However, this one somehow surpassed it where it was even more character based and personal than the first. There are so many aspects of this film that added to it and made it incredible. The action sequences were amazing, as was the animation, the score, and the character building. This movie is quite long but did not feel like it. This is also one of the best sequels of all time! I truly have no idea how they did this well on this film. My main issue with it was that this movie ends on a huge cliffhanger so it is not the full story! Other than that, it was almost a perfect film. I highly recommend everyone to go out and watch this movie, especially if you are a fan of Spider-Man!",positive
703,"We as moviegoers may throw around the word ""masterpiece"" more than we should. However, some movies truly deserve that title of ""masterpiece"". It is rare we get a movie so rich in story, so rich in characters, so rich in dialogue, so emotional, while also having phenomenal action sequences throughout. It's hard for live action movies to accomplish those feats, let alone animated movies. Yet, Spider-Man: Across the Spider Verse not only accomplishes those feats, but changes the way we should all look at animated movies. This is a truly beautiful film with a cliffhanger that will utterly stun you.",positive
704,"5 years of waiting really did pay off. I thought this movie was going to be a bit boring in the beginning but when the action scenes came, Oh there are no words to describe the pure creativeness and art because it's just too good. The first one definitely surpassed all my expectations but this doubled down on that. The songs and visuals are just perfection. This movie also does leave you on the edge of your seats most of the times to always not know what's coming next. That's what cinema is about to me and the way they express it through art and a movie like this is something way beyond. Can't wait for the sequel next year. In summary, This is a movie that I can't recommend enough. You should go watch it too, if you haven't already that is!",neutral
705,"Across the Spider-verse is truly an amazing experience. The animation styles used are even more diverse and they somehow blend with each other to make an awesome piece of art.The thing that I liked the most was the music. Metro Boomin is a very talented artist, and it shows here. The music in some scenes truly invokes strong emotions within the viewers.The story starts about a year after the events of the last movie. The new Spider-Man is now being recognised by the Brooklyn folks. The story is even better than the last movie, and the cliffhanger in the end will make waiting for the next movie a pain.",positive
706,"I barely write a review, but this movie deserves my time and effort. This is a 10/10 on so many things, Action, Humor, Drama. How it looks its stunning, its a master piece.I found it hard to watch it in the cinema cause the trailer showed the art was a 'bit too much', but I was wrong, big time, the art is magnificent, to be honest I never saw something like this, the art is truly amazing.Also the characters design and story telling is top notch, their personallity is stunning, how the background matches the feelings, how each universe has their own characters and how all it blends togheterSONY you did an amazing job, waiting for the 3rd part like a mad man.",positive
707,"From the moment the opening scene unfolds, you are transported into a mesmerizing world of vibrant colors, dynamic visuals, and mind-bending animation.

Parker, voiced by the hilarious Jake Johnson, to the introduction of new characters like Gwen Stacy, portrayed by the talented Hailee Steinfeld, each performance adds depth and dimension to the story. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, creating a sense of camaraderie and genuine connection that brings the ensemble cast to life.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse also deserves applause for its groundbreaking soundtrack.

708,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an ambitious sequel that continues the adventures of Miles Morales. This animated feature dazzles with its vibrant visual style and innovative animation techniques, offering a fresh take on the Spider-Man mythos.The film excels in its visual presentation, with each universe showcasing distinct artistic styles that reflect its unique atmosphere. The animation is a feast for the eyes, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the medium. The voice acting is strong, with Shameik Moore returning as Miles and delivering an emotionally resonant performance.However, while the film's visuals are groundbreaking, the story can feel somewhat disjointed at times. The narrative juggles multiple plotlines and characters, which can make it difficult to fully connect with any one arc. The pacing is uneven, and some scenes drag, which detracts from the overall impact.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an impressive technical achievement with a bold artistic vision. Despite its storytelling flaws, it remains a visually stunning and entertaining film that expands the Spider-Verse in exciting ways.",neutral
709,"A perfect spiderman movie, with perfect storytelling and amazing character development. Such a heartfelt movie. The character of Gwen has given extra focus. All the important character are given proper time. You will connect with all the characters as a viewer, and this is the heart of the movie. And just like the previous movie, it has mesmerizing animation and music.Some people might feel that the screen time could have been smaller, but it was required for the emotional plot development.The story hasn't finished yet, it is left with a plot twist. We will have to wait for the next movie 'Beyond the spider verse'.",positive
710,"Miles (Spider-Man) is battling 'The Spot' who blames Miles for causing his bizarre condition and also tells him that he transported the spider that originally bit Miles from a different dimension. Miles and Gwen travel to a further dimension to continue to tackle The Spot and manage to stop his reign of destruction, although in doing so Miles sees a future event where the fathers etc of Spider-Men characters in the various dimensions are killed. They are eventually joined by others from the Society who do all they can to fix the dimensional changes the the destruction has caused, albeit Miles himself has caused a major problem by saving the local police chief / a father, which is deemed to be a dimensional canon event which should never be interfered with.Improving on its predecessor, this is stunningly beautiful, exciting, action packed and witty film which also manages to pack a strong emotional punch. Everything moves at lightning speed and with so many characters moving and speaking so fast about this dimension and that I will admit that I couldn't swear I got all of it all the time. That didn't spoil it for me and I just looked on staring wide eyed at the wonder before me, just gobsmacked that this was possible. Unique.To be aware, this is most certainly a 'to be continued' story so not everything is resolved neatly. The next part is in post production - looking forward to it.",positive
711,"When I went it in to see this movie I was excited. Walking out I feel like I was cheated only to be invested for the last 20 minutes when the story actually picks up. The main villain is only in the film for maybe 10 minutes and when ever the story felt like it was dragging they would throw in cameos from past films, comics, and tv shows. For a movie that is over 2 hours it definitely felt like a cash grab from Sony only to give us a real sequel in the next movie, beyond the spider-verse. All in all it looked great visually but I can not see myself rewatching this because it felt like a filler episode.",positive
712,"Usually, after watching a movie and taking some time to reflect on it, you may find that the film becomes less impressive in your memory. You start to think, ""Maybe it was just cool to see it for the first time, but not as cool as I initially thought."" When you watch the movie again the next day, and even the day after that, as you reflect on the events, a feeling of excitement begins to overwhelm you. You genuinely want to see it again because it was really good. I've never had this kind of reaction before, so I thought I would write it down here.This movie is also the type that you can rewatch and discover something new each time. If you had it on digital, you would find yourself pausing the screen to notice all the details they packed in for us. Moreover, not once did I feel like they had any cheesy one-liners that we often encounter. In fact, there were numerous moments when not only I, but the entire theater, burst into laughter and experienced a range of emotions. The movie seamlessly blended comedy, action, vibrant colors, and a captivating soundtrack. It was truly a remarkable movie experience.",positive
713,"A lot of films seem to be exploring multiverses, and superhero films are no exception. An awesome follow up. The animation has a joyfull comic book feel to it. And not to mention the awesome voices to the characters bring incredible life to the characters.I liked the look of the other spider man from other universes. And Miles and Gwen really click, you buy there connection like from the first one. Still hoping for a live action Miles Morales and Spider Gwen movies. I like the main villain, you feel bad for him, and you understand why he does what he does. I'm really looking forward to the next film, it has an ending like The Empire Strikes Back(1980).",negative
714,As a big Spiderman fan I loved seeing all of the little Easter eggs and different Spidermen including the ps4 Spiderman. I loved everything but sometimes the animation styles kind of confused me like at the very beginning with Gwen or at the end with Miles. But overall it was an amazing movie. Miguel playing the antagonist was great even though he himself isn't his universes one Spiderman. But I loved seeing the returning and new characters and the score by metro boomin was just wow. And I know it confused me but I still loved the animation. Great movie and I highly recommend it. Go watch it!!,positive
715,"Movie: Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse
Rating:9.0/10
I just swung back from the INOX where I saw Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse and it was a web-tastic and spidey-sensational adventure!..and this movie takes the web-slinger to new dimensions. The movie features stunning animation, witty humor, and heartfelt moments as Spiderman teams up with other versions of himself from different universes(also Don't miss Pravitr Prabhakar aka Indian Spiderman: He had been given some serious importance in the film.). The movie explores the themes of identity, responsibility, and friendship in a creative and engaging way. If you are a fan of Spiderman or superhero movies in general, you will love this movie. It is a must-watch for anyone who loves adventure, action, and fun.**Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a 2023 animated superhero film that follows the adventures of Miles Morales, a teenager who becomes Spider-Man in his universe. He reunites with Gwen Stacy, a Spider-Woman from another dimension, and travels across the multiverse with her to meet other Spider-People who are part of a team called the Spider-Society. They are led by Miguel O'Hara, a Spider-Man from the future, who warns them of a new threat: the Spot, a villain who can create portals between universes and cause chaos. Miles and his new allies have to work together to stop the Spot and save the multiverse from destruction. Along the way, they face challenges, enemies, and surprises that test their friendship and heroism. The film is a sequel to **Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse** (2018)",positive
716,"Five years ago, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse shocked audiences with its innovative animation, compelling multi-verse plot, and show-stopping soundtrack. It not only won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but changed animated movies forever. How could a sequel even attempt to match - let alone exceed - that groundbreaking comic book movie? Well, the first reviews of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse have earned the follow-up a similarly exceptional Tomatometer score, with critics declaring it a bigger, better, and more visually stunning movie--perhaps one of the best sequels of all time.",positive
717,The way the Film is animated it may be the best animation movie of all time. There were like 200 different drawing styles in one. I was so overwhelmed when i saw the details when Gwen goes back to her dad and reaches out to him. Like the scene when he told her he isnt gonna be a Captain. The walls wer sooooo good. The one missing star is just because of a few things that could have been added. Like a bit longer scene with Miles from Earth-44. The cliffhanger is so well made that i would do anything to watch the next part as soon as Possible. I really liked the movie and i can just recommend it to everybody. Have fun Warhing itüòÅ,positive
718,"The movie was very entertaining, phenomenal animation and great characters. However the storyline was not good to me. It wasn't intriguing it feels a bit overplayed. I do acknowledge that this is a kids film and I'm a grown man so there's that but I really loved the first movie.and maybe set my expectations too high for this one. Based on the reviews I thought this movie would be an improvement on the first but I didn't think it was at all. I found myself uninterested at times and losing focus. Like I previously stated it is a really good movie but if you're looking for to to blow your mind like the first one did, I think you'll be disappointed.",positive
719,"An overrated but good movie, I don't have that much to say about this one other than the fact that it entertained me and there are a few funny parts, it didn't make me sad though. I didn't care for the daughter vs dad police officer drama tbh. And i didn't find the line ""ima do my own thing"" emotional but there was entertaining action in this movie. It's overall a solid movieMy Rating: 8/10 recommendedThere should be no such thing as a character limit. I remember the first time watching this movie. After this sentence the character limit will be good. My reviews are ruined because of the character limit.",positive
720,"So I love the visuals of this film and I absolutely love the animation. I viewed the first one and honestly i enjoyed it more then this one. I believe this is a 3 part series, with the third film coming out sometime next year. The story is centered around a young man that is rather socially awkward but he has a superpower after being bitten by a radioactive spider. That is pretty much it. He fights villains along the way and he is working to restore the relationship with his father along the way. Again, some good action scenes here and there but thats the main attraction with this film. I would recommend if you like comics.",positive
721,"I found the first film to be a solid movie. A bit over-indulgent and over-praised but solid. This on the other hand, takes all the bad aspects of the first movie and cranks it up to eleven. First off, this doesn't feel like a story about Miles Morales. Sadly we are still doing the multi-verse gimmick that has worn off three years ago. To top it off the 150 minutes runtime is in no way justified for offering such a thin story. Most action scenes are far too long, especially the one with the Vulture and the mid-escape chase scene. That one in particular felt like a redo of the lab chase from the first film. A lot of times the movie was trying to recreate moments from the previous installement without the heart.And what's with the mediocre voice acting this time? Especially the opening monologue of Gwen Stacy felt like it was read from last-minute cue cards. To be fair, I liked the Gwen Stacy story arc in the beginning, but then they used an unbelievable character moment to make her force her hand to join the Spiderverse. And this is where the movie lost me. This whole world and the explanation of it's existence reeks of desperate attempts of an industry that is trying to sell the same doll with a different dress. I just don't watch superheroes to see them having existential crisis, it plagues the comic movies since The Dark Knight. They even implemented this narrative hook on characters like Superman (Man of Steel) who are the antithesis of this outlook and we saw how that went down.It's no coincidence that the story got very thin after we get to the Spiderverse. From then on the writers can only throw action set pieces after the audience to fill up the two and a half hours runtime (!). Seriously it was really boring, sometimes laughable (that shot of the hologram that reveals the serious face of Spiderman 2099) and the scenes that were supposed to make you laugh were tired. Especially the quips during the action were otherworldly bad. And once the dust settled, they filmmakers could not even manage to end it in a mildly satisfying conclusion. There are ways to end a story with certain degree of closure while some story strands aren't resolved. It's an art for a reason. But this is just plain lazy. What they dish out as a cliffhanger should have been the mid-turning-point of the movie. If they had any talented writers at all they would have made this movie with Miles and Gwen in their respectable world without crossing over into the other person's universe. Seemingly having a different story but with the same theme connecting them. That would of course require more work in the writing department to pull off, but you can tell that right after the success of the first movie they wanted to keep the machine running to churn out another one of these as fast as possible. And although four years seems like a long time for a movie, I can assure it's not for an animated movie. Especially one with this magnitude of animation quality, runtime and post production requirements. Unfortunately it didn't deliver, I was honestly rooting for this film but at least I don't regret anymore that I missed it in cinema.4 out of 10.",negative
722,"I really loved ""into the Spiderverse"" and so this sequel is one that I've been looking forward to for a while. I'm so happy that it doesn't disappoint and even manages to improve on almost every aspect from the first.Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is invited to join ""The Spider Society"" after helping Spiderman 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and Jessica Drew (Issa Rae) defeat a Renaissance variant Vulture (Jorma Tacccone) in her world. The Spider Society jump between universes fixing anomalies. Months later, she comes back to Miles Morales' (Shameik Moore) world, tracking The Spot (Jason Schwartzman) a villain able to utilise holes in space to commit crimes. Though specifically told not to, she makes contact with Miles and drags him to another universe with disastrous consequences.It's a great story. Clever and well thought through and allowing for great deal of both humour and pathos. There are hundreds of Spiderman variants in the film, most are played for laughs and can have little more than a few seconds screentime, but some are key, such as Hobie - The Spider-Punk variant from England voiced by Daniel Kaluuya or Spiderman India voice by Karan Soni. The main variants from the last film don't really re-appear, until the very end of the movie - with the exception of Peter B Parker - voiced again by Jake Johnson.But visually the film is a step up too, something that I wouldn't have thought possible. The blending of various different animation styles is amazingly well done. How the interactions between these characters work is staggering. It's a genuine joy to just to look at something that this much effort has gone into and is this dynamic.I can't imagine for a second that this won't be very close to my best film of the year, come December. It's certainly the one to beat.",positive
723,"It's also one of the best pieces of pop art ever. Taking everything that was good in the first Spider-Verse and amping things up by a lot.This warrants several re-viewings as there is just so much detail and at times such a furious pace, so well timed comedy, a truly *specatcular* sound and music mix as well.Imaginative is the main word for it, but the film also has amazing soul and a lot of poignancy, also themes of parenting resonated in the adult in me. The inner kid was grinning like a fool the whole time as well.Don't miss this one out on the big screen, definitely worth leaving the comfy home cinema for!",positive
724,"This has got to be the best Spider-Man movie of all time! Every comic book fan, every movie fan and every fan who has ever played Spider-Man video games is going to simply love this movie. This is an animation masterpiece!The animation is top-notch, the visuals are absolutely out of this world, this movie plunges the viewer into a totally immersive and mind-blowing experience.The story was wonderfully crafted, with the blend of so many different characters, this movie definitely stands out.With so many references /easter-eggs /callouts to previous movies and the comic books(obviously) its an absolute treat to watch and enjoy one of the best superhero movie which isn't live action.",positive
725,"What a fantastic film. One of the greatest works of art ever made, period. The animators who worked on this movie are truly something else. There are many different styles and fresh ideas that function with the comic book aesthetic of the whole thing. It develops naturally from across the spider verse to become a fitting sequel, learning more about some of the other Spider-men and women, especially Gwen. It definitely feels a bit more serious and I am very excited about the villain (who I won't spoil) and his potential. They tied in other spider-man movies to it which is pretty cool. My rating is 9 stars only because, frankly, I'm not sure I see Beyond the Spider-verse becoming a good finisher of the story, but I could be wrong. Once I watch the second half of this story then I think I'll have a proper opinion on how well this movie did in setting up the future events. It is also a bit slower paced and definitely more mature of a film than Into, but it fits seeing as how the characters are more grown and the stakes are much higher than they've ever been. It also focuses less on Miles's family and more about who he must become in the future as Spider-Man and as his own person, which fits super well. Not sure if I like this or Into more, but they are both artistic spectacles that everyone who doesn't suffer from epilepsy should definitely 100% watch!",positive
726,"I've watched this movie 3 times now in theaters , and honestly I keep finding a reason to go back. This movie is brilliant with its score and feel with the characters. Somehow I was worried that it would not measure up the first movie which was amazing, but was STUNNED at how they just got better with this movie. The tone from kid friendly to a new Miles who has grown and attitude seems older and the themes which are more adult are just what this film needed. There is not one scene in this film where I am not fully immersed in the story. This is nothing short of a masterpiece with the art in this moving shining with every scene. Part 2 will have a hard time living up to this because I already can't wait till it's out on DVD to watch it more.",positive
727,"Across the Spider-Verse is one of the best pieces of animation I have ever seen, The constantly changing art styles with each frame looking like its been pulled straight from a comic book! The fact they managed to pair that with one of the best superhero plots I've seen in a long time. It has massive stakes whilst never straying far from the personal character arcs and plot points.The runtime this film has allows it to pause the action to give long moments for characters to just talk and those moments are some of the best parts of the film for me.If you're a fan of animation or marvel you have to see this film!",positive
728,"Neither. This movie is a 7. Spider-Verse suffers from a few shortcomings. The pacing occasionally feels uneven, with certain sequences dragging on while others appear rushed. Some plot points and character arcs also lack the development they deserve, leaving certain aspects feeling underdeveloped or unresolved. These issues prevent the film from reaching its full potential and hinder its impact on the audience.Spider-Verse is an artistic triumph, utilizing breathtaking animation and an innovative storytelling approach. While it falls short in certain areas, it still manages to captivate and entertain. With its visually stunning aesthetics and a solid narrative, Spider-Verse stands as a worthy addition to the Spider-Man universe. I would recommend this film to both dedicated fans and newcomers alike, as it offers a fresh take on the beloved superhero. Ultimately, Spider-Verse deserves a 7 out of 10, marking it as an enjoyable and visually stunning cinematic experience.",positive
729,"Spiderman Across The Spidey Verse is the sequel to the 2018 film Spiderman Into The Spidey Verse(2018).The movie stars Shailek Moore,Hailee Steinfeld and Jason Schwartzmann. Gwen Stacey(Steinfeld) now Spider Woman teams up with Miles Morales in a different universe to take out the sneaky Spot(Schwartzmann) who seeks revenge on Miles. Will they save New York City from Spot? Or will they get help from other Spidermen from the different universes?Overall I thought it was a very good movie. Just like the original it has beautiful animation styled like a comic book,the story was engaging and the voice acting was top notch. I guess the only complaint is that the film is very long especially an animated film as they are usually on for 80 minutes or 104 minutes. If you've got kids they might be feeling uneasy or then again they might not feel the running time passing by.A-Also features Donald Glover.",positive
730,"I saw this movie on every corner of the internet. People were all hyping it and I got curious. So I decided to watch this movie and wasn't disappointed. I really liked it. I love the characters, the quality of the animation, the storyline... Most of the things about this movie are good. Most of the things... Even though it has a great storyline, it is way too fast. You sometimes cannot understand what the heck is going on. Also, I did not like the ending at all. It takes a thousand witnesses to call it an ending. There is no conclusion at the end. Which I hate. To wrap up, even though its animation quality, storyline, and characters were good, the ending did not have any conclusion and sometimes it was way too fast. But still, I think you should go check it out!",positive

I need it, it's so hard to wait, I feel tortured, I would definitely recommend it, (probably should watch into the spider-verse before) if you're a superhero fan. Great movie, watch it, it's wonderful, it's one of the best spider-man movies ever.Can't wait for beyond the spider-verseWATCH IT!",positive
732,"Watched this in a double-feature at a drive-in. The other film was The Super Mario Bros. Movie, so this was a refreshing pallet cleanser. Unfortunately, the poor audio mixing made it really hard to hear much of the movie. On the plus side, I had the tastiest cheese fries I've ever had! It also started raining which made the fries taste extra good for some reason?Firstly, the animation is BOUNDS better than the first movie, which was already revolutionary, Somehow, this manages to take that and improve on it! The fight at the beginning with the Leonardo da Vinci-style Vulture is one of my favorite animated fights now. They really went all-out with the stylization this time, as they really made characters like Pavitr Prabhakar and Spider-Punk stand out visually. The colors go HARD, especially during the very end and the Gwen-father scenes.Secondly, I must address my few complaints with the movie. 1. Miles feels... off throughout. They didn't seem to know quite what to do with his character in this, so he got sidelined by all of the new characters and Gwen. He has a good fight-chemistry with The Spot, but that plot gets tossed out the window halfway through, making it unsatisfying. 2. None of the characters from the original movie other than Miles, Gwen, and Peter B. Parker have a real role to play. I think Penny gets a few lines, but she had the most, and it was definitely around 10 at most. (I especially am upset at this because the Nicolas Cage Spider-Noir was my favorite character in the first.) 3. It feels very jumbled. They had at least 5 directions they were trying to take the story that all got their own segment in this. They sporadically pick up plotlines and set them back down, which leads to an inconsistent viewing experience. The first film is largely consistent: very focused on Miles developing into Spider-man and stopping Kingpin. This one has the Gwen-father drama, the idea of the Spider-verse, Miles continuing to grow into Spider-man, Miles trying to stop the Spot, Miles trying to escape from Spider-man 2099, Miles grappling with the betrayal of his friends, Miles getting trapped at the end, the consequences of the Spider-verse's collapse, etc - all making it a constant effort to keep up with. 4. The ending. Not a major problem, but I've never been a fan of cliffhangers where you actually have to wait a long period of time to get resolved. EXCLUDING mysteries. This isn't much of a mystery- we know Miles will escape somehow.Thirdly, the score and sound design (NOT the mixing) are great. And hey, the songs weren't Sunflower! I liked Annihilate to a degree. The song during the fight with Vulture was creative.Fourthly, Jason Schwartzman plays the sexiest character in the film. Most of the rest are children, so this is probably why.Fifthly, I like the worldbuilding. I just think there's too much for one film. I really think a lot of my problems will be solved by the sequel to this.",positive
733,Its been a year since miles and the other spider people saved new york from kingpin. Not a lot has changed but miles is taller and because of the explosion a new villion called the spot has been created. We start by seeing gwens side of things. The art style is different over there and I really liked how it was done. She has her own problems going on snd after reveling herself to her father shes saved by two new spider people . We then go to miles universe and his still in school for some reason. Gwen meets him and everything evolves from there. I loved the spider chase and the amount of different spider people we meet. A heavy hitter but of course we get a to be continued before more action starts. Its a good decision to make it a two parter. Great animation as always and overall just a great film.,positive
734,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.",positive
735,"This is a must see, as soon as you can, kind of movie! From beginning to end this movie was excellent and dare I say it is better than ""Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse"" Now the first film was the best Spider-Man movie of all time that out did even the live action movies. This movie, ""Spider-Man across the Spider-Verse"" was better than its predecessor. I will put it below at second place because it's a part one of two, but it is a close first. There's not much I can nor want to say because this is one of those films you'll want to watch and buy to own and see for yourself with friends and family on a movie night.",positive
736,Watched on Netflix on 14/11/2023 after the inital histeria from the cinema had died down; with my Monitor Audios on at a nice volume.Well the most enjoyable feature was the beautiful homage to Stan Lee! Rip; Sir! A posthumous appearance in your own franchise! Wow!So. I watched the previous franchises and I loved them. This one however left me a bit perplexed. Sure it's comic book-style and sure it's about the multiverse but I just found it a bit repetitive and a bit thin on the story compared to other editions.The bad guys were prominent Marvel features and they played a nice homage to the storyline. However the sequences were not quiet what I had envisaged. There was some great spots like the opening sequence; the grafiti sequence; where he meets his Uncle and they chill to vinyl etc but later-on I felt the character development got a bit thin.All of a sudden we're experiecing multi-verses and people disappearing and all sorts of weird body-transformations. It just got a bit too silly; like a child's play and not as serious as I thought it would be. I really like the recent shows but this was defiinitely a bit of a letdown. The audio and sfx was superb but the screenplay could have been improved.,positive
737,"I originally made this review on June 25, 2024 on Letterboxd and I rewatched for the review.I've re-watched this movie 3 or 4 times and it's been quite a while so I'm going to write an actual review of it.This film's animation is gorgeous it has a lot of personality into one movie & this is the best Spider-Man film ever made even though Sam Ramey's Spider-Man Trilogy is amazing which I love don't get me wrong but the fact that I love Miles Morales is my favorite multiverse Spider-Man also that I'm a big Animation fan I love this film to death the best Spider-Man ever! I know you disagree with but that's I respect your opinion but this is my movie I rather watch this than Madame Web.",positive
738,"I really did enjoy the first one and.. In all honesty i'd say this one doesn't live up to the first.It's scatterbrained. It has some idea, but it's just pointlessly long with lots of ""nothing"" moments.I this segment i will spoil ""drawing quality"" of the movie. Well in first one, if I remember correctly every scene was fully drawn. In here, however, I'm not sure if that's some artistic choice, or by 'saving money', alot.. and i mean AWFULY ALOT of scenes have unfinished phase-to-white canvas (like most of them, seriously), like they didn't want you to see anything beyond main characters. There's also alot of colour filters that try to tell you emotions of what characters feel and it looks... so... cheap. Not only you get less than half of a drawn room (without any details), the colour of everything is affected by whatever drama we have.Big spoilers: Spider-man: AtU did something i wasn't happy with. They've to but it blandly created a Rick Sanchez flavoured Citadel of Ricks for Spider Mans from alot of universes. It's beautiful (at least whenever we get fully drawn scenes).. But this idea just doesn't fit. If that was small multi-dimensional group, then sure.. But whole city of spidermans? Eh. It just doesn't fit. Now every spiderman you meet is a multi-dimensional traveler and doesn't sound like brooklyns ""friendly neighbourhood spiderman"". It feels like spider-man lost a small part of his identity with that plan. I don't know if that's comic-canon, so i might be in the wrong here, though.Another spoiler: Director tries to go with the plot as the ""canon"", or spidermans do not have free will and are bound to do certain things no matter the universe.. And... okay... But it just sounds slightly forcefully stitched. Now thinking back I can see how in the first movie they made those ""anchor points"" in story so the second could use them for this plot and i already see the path they will go for the third (as in: spidermans have free will, they can break away from fate/canon)... It's just feels.. eh... ""weak"". The concept was slightly hinted in SM1 (every spidey has someone they lost), but now the whole movie revolves around it. Not to mention Miles Morales has already lost his uncle ben and his brief mentor, the ""original"" spider man.. So you could say he should be past that.. And yet he isn't.Finally I really dislike how Spider-Man didn't exactly end as a movie. It felt like watching a (long) serial that ends on cliffhanger right before the finalle.It's not a bad movie and it didn't really have any ideolo in it.. Or at least i didn't feel like it had - which is great. Should you watch it? Even if just for visuals: yes, overall it's not terrible and fight scenes are 'chef kiss'.",negative
739,This was great. Just spectacular. Great story. Great characters. Good dynamics. Great stakes. Amazing animation. This helped push the boundaries of what western animation could accomplish and I think showed many they could step up their game in the animation field. My only hope is that studios take the right lessons from this and learn from this masterpiece which came together like a great stew with a whole lot of ingredients that blend together seamlessly into an amazing experience they couldn't be on their own. The music was good accentuating the action and story. The use of color was skillful perfect at conveying themes and emotions. Every part of this film felt purposeful and impactful.,positive
740,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is even better than the first movie! It takes us on an exciting adventure through different worlds, where we see both our favorite characters and some new ones. The movie looks amazing and tells a story that really touches our hearts.One of the best parts of this movie is how it shows respect for the first one while also adding new and surprising things. The first movie had a special way of looking, and it told a really nice story with great characters that we loved. But in Across the Spider-Verse, things get even more exciting, and it takes us to new places we didn't expect, making it even cooler than before!The animation is like a beautiful picture book, with every part full of excitement and imagination. The colorful scenes show different worlds, and the smooth, action-packed moments make us feel amazed. Every single second shows how creative and talented the people who made it are!In Across the Spider-Verse, we get to know the characters we loved from the first movie even better. They grow and face new problems, which makes us really care about what happens to them. The movie has lots of exciting action, touching moments, and interesting ideas, making it a special experience to watch. Just remember, this movie is only the first part of a bigger story!In short, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing movie that is just as good as the first one and even better in some ways. It takes us to new and exciting places in the Spider-Man world, full of creativity and feelings. The animation is really beautiful, the characters are interesting, and the story is well-told. This movie shows how special animated films can be, and everyone is excited to see what happens next in this fantastic series.Picking one of the two is really hard, like trying to pick your favorite toy. The first one is a really good story that feels close and cozy, while the second one is much bigger and takes you on an exciting adventure. Both are great, just in their own special ways!",positive
741,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a whirlwind of narratives that sometimes struggles to find its core. The abundance of stories leaves little room for deep exploration. However, its saving grace lies in its humor, constant amusement, and breathtaking visual spectacle. Every frame bursts with artistic innovation, a feast for the eyes. Despite narrative hiccups, the film's ability to engage your senses in a roller-coaster of colors and animation is undeniable. As it hurtles towards a cliffhanger, you can't help but be captivated. In the end, its audacious visual style and entertaining humor overshadow the narrative shortcomings, making it a must-watch for fans of Spidey and those seeking an electrifying cinematic ride.",neutral
742,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant sequel that surpasses its predecessor in nearly every way. Miles Morales' journey through the multiverse is filled with breathtaking animation, memorable characters, and thought-provoking themes. The film's exploration of identity, destiny, and the sacrifices required to be a hero is both poignant and powerful. While the cliffhanger ending may leave some wanting more, it sets the stage for an epic conclusion in the upcoming third installment. I would definitely recommend this amazing picture to anyone of my friends and family.",positive
743,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse swings onto the big screen, delivering a breathtaking display of visual artistry, heartfelt storytelling, and pulse-pounding action. This highly anticipated sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse surpasses all expectations, offering an unforgettable cinematic experience in just under two hours.From the first frame, it's evident that this film is a visual masterpiece. The combination of cutting-edge CGI and the seamless integration of various art styles creates a mesmerizing and dynamic world. Each scene bursts with vibrant colours, intricate details, and a boundless sense of creativity. The fusion of different art styles within a single frame is a stroke of brilliance, elevating the film to new heights of visual splendour.",neutral
744,"I had heard a lot about this going in and I dunno if it's the best film of the year but it's certainly a visual spectacle.to say the leastThe multiversal aspects of this film are certainly not new to the genre and after seeing Dr Strange 2 , the Marvel What IF season and The Flash - the core themes are the same albeit executed in different creative waysWhat sets this apart is how accessible it is to a wider audience and how it keeps you guessing as to what is to happen nextI'm sure there are many fan theories of what the next film might entail and truth be told the ending raises more questions than answers but until then we would have to wait to see where things go in this.",positive
745,"Across the spider verse picks up some time after the events of into the spider verse (I don't think they specify the exact time but I'm guessing.... Maybe a year...?)Miles is settling into life as brooklynns one and only spider man.... And... All seems good for him....Meanwhile... In Gwens universe.... Things aren't goin to great for Hailee Seinfelds GwenShe's still kickin ass as spidergwen.... But her relationship with her dad is.....strained....and she's doin too well with her friends either...So when she given the opportunity to ditch her universe and go join Oscar Isaacs spiderman 2099 and issa raes spider woman (both characters who look cool asf btw).... She jumps at the chance... And this sets the plot in motion....Various multiverse shenanigans ensue and that brings Gwen back to Miles' universe....Miles learns more about the (massive) spider multi verse as he follows Gwen down the rabbit hole (so to speak)We learn just how vast the multiverse is... And the core conflict here between miles, Gwen, miguel etc is just how to handle it...Not all of the spider people agree on how best to protect the spiderverse....I don't want to say to much more about the plot other than that.... The trailers didn't really give too much away (and this is a good thing... Far too many trailers these days just tell you the whole movie!)This movie is as much Gwens story as miles... So much so that I'm sure if you did a screen time comparison.... It'd be pretty close to 50 50 reckon...What did I like about the movie....I'd like to preface my review by saying I probably went into this movie a little bias... And exceedingly high expectations as the first movie, Into the spider verse, is legit an amazing movie IMHO....Not only is it a great superhero movie, not only is it a great animated movie... It's simply a great movie.AND... It's the best spidermans movie.Yes... It's better than spiderman 2...and it's better than no way home (come at me Internet!)So I went I to this one with HIGH HOPES..Firstly... It's absolutely gorgeous to look at...Just like the first movie.... Every single frame is a work of art (I literally got a canvas made of a frame from the first movie... I'll try and put here for you to see)The animation builds on what into the spiderverse originated and just takes it up a notch (or 4!)It really is a beautiful piece of art...The voice talents are, again, phenomenal.... Shameek moore and hailee steinfeld really our their heart and soul (via their voices) into their characters....The action scenes are top quality as well,The relationships with their parents are given much more screen time here....
Both Gwen and Miles get quite a lot of scenes with their parents.... (one stand out scene between mikes and mother really is an emotional bomb... Much like the scene in the first one with miles and his dad, when miles is tied up in the chair and can't speak... And his dad has that monologue from behind the door.... (shut up! I'm not crying... You are!) this movie has a similar scene where miles mum has an emotional gut punch of a monologue.... About being a parent, and protecting your child emotionally.... But realising you have to let go of that at some point.... (again... Shut up! I'm not crying... You are!It's a stand out scene for me (I think they actually released that whole scene as part of the promotion... If they did I link I up here...)So yeah, plenty of scenes with family drama and emotions.... So the characters have time to grow and develop.... Buuuuuuut.... It's almost too much time....With a run time of like 2 hours 20.... It does feel a little long... And the pacing is very slow in the first act....It kinda felt like the movie didn't really get goin until like the 30 minute mark....And for those who don't know.... This is very much a part one of a 2 part series
.. (or part 2 of a Trilogy....)Its kinda got empire strikes back vibes in that regard... In that there's a lot happening in the movie, lots of world building and it ends on a cliffhanger and om word.... It's a pretty epic cliffhanger....I think the kid who was sitting a few seats along from me put it best...He was clearly a spidey fan (t shirt, hat, collectable spiderman cup from cineworld)... He definitely enjoyed the movie.... But at the end.... When the cliffhanger happened and the text bubble read 'to be continued..... He said' whhhaaaat!? They do this at EVERY movie now.... Cant they just make it one movie!I think once the third movie is out.... This movie will be viewed as the awkward middle child.Don't get me wrong... I liked this movie... And I'm hyped for the next one....I think the film makers had an almost impossible task.... Follow on from the near perfect, universally loved (and Oscar winnin) into the spiderverse.... While setting up the 3rd (and final?) movie in the series.Time will tell.So gonna go with 7/10 for this one (for context, I'd give into the spider verse 9/10)Thats all folks@ScottishGeekGuy on YouTube and socialsPeace.",positive
746,"I completely understand your excitement and enthusiasm about this movie. It is truly a remarkable gem that has captured the hearts of many viewers. The storyline, characters, and overall production are just flawless. It's not every day that you come across a movie that leaves such a lasting impression on its audience. And it's even more rare to find an animated movie that can compete with live-action movies. But this movie has done just that, and it has set a new standard for animated movies. It's no wonder that you can't wait for the third movie to come out, as the second one has already exceeded your expectations. I can only imagine how much more incredible the third one will be. I hope that it will continue to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. Overall, it's fantastic to see a movie that has the ability to bring so much joy and excitement to its viewers.",positive
747,"There was a lot of missing tension that was definitely pulling the movie back, most intense scenes lost all their tension after a comedic relief gag. The villain's entrance was weird, why would his character need to rob an ATM? Overall decent except the cliff hanger is very annoying, not a very innovative way to bring about another movie. The ending seemed like they rushed to put in a bunch of characters that they wanted to show and threw them in for show. In all it seemed like a Avengers infinity war type deal. I can't wrap my head around how this movie is currently rated a nine, if you watch the other movies rated nine or above you will recognize this and its lacking qualities.",neutral
748,"No. I love the Spider-Man character and have watched almost everything known /including the feature films/, but this particular Multiverse is not to my taste at all.The main character /Miles Morales/ - the new Spider-man - is boring and uninteresting to me. Somehow, forcibly, I feel like the creators are trying to make us like him. The whole plot of the movie is a total mess - it tries to be original, but to be honest, the only thing I liked was the animation somewhat, even though it was in times less recreated compared to the first movie. The character of Gwen Stacy is cool too.The villains are super forgettable. The supporting characters are a total detriment. The drama is forced in and doesn't fit the story at all. The comedic elements are sucked out of the fingers. On top of that, the film is super long.I just have no words for what they have turned the Spider-Man story into. They better come up with a new character in Hollywood with a new more interesting and original story. There's no new audience if a new movie about this character is going to come out every 5 years...Final score: 3/10.",negative
749,"The only reason i even signed up for imdb was to give a review for this movie. This movie is amazing there arent going to be any spoilers here but the animation, the emotion, the plot and the plot twists will not fail to keep you engaged in the movie till the end. First half starts of okay with normal stuff but second half was so lit. If you are sick and tired of repetitive movies and plots and want your mind blown by amazing animation and plot this movie is for you. This is a masterpiece, a movie made to be loved by every person. The ending leaves you stunned and thinking for hours together. Amazing work by animators and directors and screenplay too.",positive
750,"Spiderverse 1 is my second favorite movie of all time. It's a 10/10. For five years I've waited for this movie, convincing myself it could never live up to the original- there's no way... how wrong was I. I've just had the best movie theater experience I've ever had. It's easily the best animated (as in- the animation) film of all time- even the first isn't competition. The story is kinetic, stunning and shocking. The only tiny issue was I felt it overpaced itself a bit in the middle, but I suspect that will lessen on a second viewing. All I can say is get to a theater as soon as you can. To Phil Lord, Chris Miller, the directors, everyone on the creative team and the 1000 animators, you're incredible. As I said to my friends walking out, this is going to be the longest pregnancy of all time (9 months till beyond the spider verse). See this movie.9.5/10.",positive
751,"I Can confidently say the writers of this triology Know how to write and showcase spider-man.This is the best Multiverse movie of the last 5 years, it brings to shame all the mcu attempts of multiverse movies.This is a comic book come to life. Sony has flexed its power showcasing all its work of the last 2 decades in this movie. This is Sony's spider-man endgame. This is as much gwen's story as it is of miles.This Triology along with the 2 spiderman ps4 games show exactly what it means to be spiderman. There was so much on screen i could'nt keep up but i feel like i saw almost 3 styles of animation in this movie, but there must be more. The only nit pick i have is this is more of a "" to be continued full stop"" rather than a true cliff-hanger.I have to say the people who played the ps4 marvel spider-man and Spider-man Miles Morales are gonna have a blast with the film.Once again deserving of the best animation feature Oscar.Don't be shocked if people call it the best comic book movie so far.My rating 9/10.",positive
752,"One of the best animated films I've seen and possibly one of the best superhero films that came out in recent years. This is a direct sequel to ""Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse"" where we follow Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), now as a more experienced Spiderman. Missing his fellow spider friends and dealing with the coexistence of Miles and Spiderman, Miles is met with a new villain named 'The Spot' (Jason Schwartzman). A seemingly harmless villain of the week type. Over the course of the film, it's revealed he is much more than that. Miles then with Gwen Stacy/ Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld) is sucked into the multiverse to reveal a spider community, and the conspiracy being held there.I feel as the film's uniqueness firstly comes from the animation. It's unlike anything I've seen as a child growing up and now as an adult. I love how all these huge characters are able to be depicted so different than we are used to. Even in subtle differences. The score in the film also has the effect where you are swept off your feet as a viewer and are invested in the ongoing events unfolding.Like the first film, I loved every single voice performance. Each character is voiced with passion and care. Miguel O'hara/ Spiderman 2099 (Oscar Isaac), especially stood out to me. His character is carried with pain and sorrow, and the voice acting followed by a wicked design is uncanny. Another plus is the comedic timing. This film doesn't shy from a a few good laughs, and they work splendidly.I am eager for the next film to come out and to watch this trilogy conclude. This film has plot twists, raw emotion, heartfelt moments, badass action sequences, is funny as hell and overall a wonderful watch. Much better than any live-action superhero film we've seen in recent years, by far. The runtime is under two and a half hours and honestly, I could sit for another two and a half hours straight after to absorb the full story.",positive
753,"I was honestly a little scared that this one wasn't going to be as good as the first one but am i glad it prove me wrong, so very wrong. This movie is a masterpiece and i am 100% going to watch it again in the cinema and buy it as soon as it comes out.The backstory of spot was honestly so good and i loved the callback to the bagel hit from the first one, the relationship between miles and his parents made both me and my friend cry, i really hope they'll be okay in the third one.I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes animation or spiderman or anyone who just likes good movies and you will not be disappointed.",positive
754,"Miles isn't the same kid from the first movie, he's more overconfident and knows better than the adults, because as he's said multiple times in the movie I'm not a kid. 15 makes you a kid in the world, and he lives in a universe with 1,000 of other spider-people he's not special anymore, but somehow he knows more about being spider-man than far more experienced version in other timelines. It's also upsetting that my favorite Spider-man, Miguel O'Hara is turned into the secondary antagonist because he's trying to do the right thing, has far more knowledge and experience but somehow doesn't know what he's talking about, Miles is a better than everyone. It's just not consistent with the first movie. If you watch the movie with Miles as the antagonist trying to destroy the multiverse, and Miguel and the spider society trying to save it, makes more sense. With that point of view a more enjoyable movie. I really love the animation and the music. I also love the new design of Miguel O'Hara costume it's different than the original look, but still amazing. Overall it's not a terrible movie but not incredible as most people would have you believe, hopefully the final chapter is much better and brings it all back together.",positive
755,"This movie is a peace of art. The animations, the plot twist at the end of the movie, the new developed characters are amazing. The antagonist is great, the vilian as well. It's crazy how a kid's movie may be so deep full of drama. It's appropriate for every group of ages. Even an adult may be in love with the story. I also appreciate that they gave us more about Gwen's backstory. The Earth-042 version of Miles is such an character and I want to know more about him. The ending was such a masterpiece which leads as with the expectations that the sequel won't be trash and it won't be just for the money.",positive
756,"I'm a bit late for this review. I watched it last weekend (june 2023) in a good IMAX theater, and again, I have to say that this is the way to watch it: in the biggest theater you can find, with the largest highest resolution screen available, and with the loudest sound system possible. You will want it to cover the children screaming during the session.My initial reaction was, ""Wow, this is great!"". You won't regret going to watch it in a good theater. It's a feast for your senses. The animation, again, is gorgeous. They expanded what they did in the first movie and went overboard. The action sequences, in particular, are fantastic. Even after dozens of Marvel movies, this one does feel fresh and exciting to watch. I will definitely re-watch it on Blu-Ray.The technical aspects are mostly great. The direction is good. Editing is good. The casting is spot on once again. Soundtrack, visual effects, etc. There's not much to complain about here, mostly nitpicking.Now, the story gives me pause. And to be fair, this is chapter 1 of a 2 part story. So many elements here need the next movie to see if they'll pay off.One example is the shift in Gwen's role. In the first movie, she was a very good support character. But in this second entry, they moved her to protagonist territory. One can argue that this movie is as much about Miles as it is about Gwen. It's a bold move, and Gwen is really a good character. But again, I hope they don't screw her backstory up with unnecessary politics, as some theories have been arguing over TikTok. I don't think they would be stupid enough to waste a billion-dollar franchise in stupid niche politics, but again, we need the finale to know for sure. So her story will only pay off if they keep they don't side-track her.On Miles's side, they wanted more character development, but they tried too hard to make us like his family. For example, they wanted us to think of his father as ""endearing,"" but they shot too far and almost came up as ""goofy"" to me. The mother, they wanted to make her look wise, and they gave her the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" part. But it was many paragraphs long. Super long speech that I think shot too far. It was a bit too much. They could have cut some of that. It was not too much to the point of exhaustion, but it was too close.I really liked Oscar Isaac's take on Miguel O'Hara. I remember reading the 2099 series in the 90s when they were released. And they make it justice here. But again, I think they went a bit too far in the ""justified totalitarian"" approach. It's just half the story, however. We need the next movie to know for sure.There were many comic reliefs, such as the Spider India guy. That sequence was great. Completely unnecessary for the story but entertaining nonetheless.Spider-Punk walked a fine line in politics between being cool and another mindless ideologue. As with Miguel, we need the next movie to know which. He stole the scenes he was in, though, that's for sure.Now, we have to hold our breaths here. One way this story could go very wrong is to argue that maybe spiderman doesn't need a traumatic canon event, maybe there's a compromise, like Spider India. If they do that, they destroy spiderman. The way for the 3rd act to go on is to validate that yes, in order to be the best spiderman, one has to endure the most traumatic loss and stand up. That's the core of the character. They better keep it intact, otherwise this whole series becomes automatic nuclear trash.All in all, it's an overall very well-balanced movie, with good character development, backstories, and action sequences to spice them up. It had the cruel job of being the middle of the road, paying off the first movie and setting things up for the third act. I don't think it's Empire Strikes Back level, but it's not too shabby. It's a very competent second act.I think it's a very solid 7 out of 10. And this score can change depending on the third movie. If it pays off, it becomes an 8 out of 10. If the storytelling betrays the expectations set in this episode, it flops to a 5 out of 10.",positive
757,"This ends on a cliffhanger and they didn't advertise this as a part 1. That really annoyed me. It makes me not go to see the next part, because who knows if they'll do the same thing? I wouldn't be surprised if they string people along for a good 8 or 9 movies. The movie itself was the first movie x 10. I think they thought that if it was cool and worked in the first movie then they should put 10 times more of it in the second movie. It doesn't work that way, not for me. It was too full of ""cool"" things and didn't do enough to add depth and story. I didn't have to see 9000 Spider-people. I would have been happy with the ones from the first movie. Though Hobie was fun.They lied by omission. I'm angry about it. I'm not going to see the next one.",positive
758,"This movie imo took a big success from the 1st one and made it even better. 1st one was already very cool for its animation style, music and the story, and the 2nd one made the animation style, music and story even better! The use of colour in different universes is amazing, you never get board from different texture each scene.Almost 10/10! One thing that caught my attention to give it a 9/10 is that I noticed each chapter followed the same formula... Intro to the scene, bish bash battle/cool visuals, then 1 to 1 meaningful conversation of each characters. All the scenes were super cool, but all felt very very shonen (like similar to meaningful convo/learning moments in Naruto and One Piece) and once it got to the 4th time round of this formula, felt too much (maybe I'm struggling to handle the too much slickness and coolness of the movie haha)Overall, loved it and can't wait for the next one!",positive
759,"The Spider-Verse movies are out of this world. This sequel is - if possible - even better than the first one. I created an IMDB-account for the sole reason of leaving this review.The story is incredibly well-written and somehow manages to provide the necessary backstory to help you empathise with every character. And there are a lot of them.The character arcs are original and handled with elegance and care, all the while paying tribute to the fun that is so innate to and essential for the character of Spider-Man.And then there's the animation. Dear god. They managed to take ""show, don't tell"" to a whole new level. The animation team understands like no one before them ever has that film is a cross-medial art form and they take full advantage of the endless possibilites that provides. The character design between universes, the use of background to emphasise emotion and develop the plot, the consistently balanced play between different art styles... It's mindblowing.Contrary to what some of the negative reviews are saying, I believe this story would have made for a great superhero movie in any style, especially considering how a lot of superhero blickbusters are being handled these days, but the animation puts in it a league of its own.I'll rewatch this at least once a year for the rest of my life.",positive
760,"I definetly went across the Spider-Verse watching this one. My favorite character is Peter Porker. Such a silly, funny guy. Hes soooo cute. NOBODY compares to him. He is HIM. I think Peter Porker shouldve been the MAIN character. Who even is MILES? This movie was earth shattering and world changing. I think that this movie is awesome sauce. I wish that I was Peter Porker because he is extra awesome sauce. I know that everyone will agree with me when I say this. Peter Porker Rules!! I think that they should make a movie that is SOLELY for Peter Porker. He adds so much character to the movies. He is such a cutie.",neutral
761,"Spiderman: Across the spider verse is one of the marvel's finest movies I've ever seen. Starting at the story all the way to the music.The spider verse is shown in the best way possible in that movie, with all the different Spidermen. The characters, by the way are all original and special in their own ways. The art style in the movie is very pretty, colorful and honestly just impressive. The movie's story is very interesting, deep and keeps up the tension at all times. The ending leaves a question mark in viewer's head which is honestly really nice. Lastly the music in across the spider verse is very fitting, important characters have their own theme and it fits them perfectly. The songs are really catchy and each time I listen to them I replay the key scenes in my head.Overall the movie is really great and I give it the well deserved 10/10.",positive
762,"This movie is soo soo good. Didn't expect it to get better than the first film which was already a masterpiece. This one is levels above it and I mean it. The animation is top notch and story is just crazy good. Along with all this, the soundtrack by metro Boomin is perfect with some beautiful songs. This is by far one of the best Spider-Man movies of all time. The wide list of Spider-Man in this movie and the various Easter eggs and references hidden in the movie is amazing for any comic book fan. If the spider verse movies follow the same pattern then beyond the spider verse is gonna be the greatest Spider-Man movie of all time. To top it all of just wanna say ""I am Brooklyn's only Spider-Man"".",positive
763,"The animation was beautiful because it wasn't just cgi and a section of the movie was animated by a fourteen year old and so I think that is awesome. They did a really good job of capturing all of the stuff you could have in a move like action, comedy, fun, etc. I love how it ends off of a cliffhanger so that it's hyped for the next movie and everyone was talking about this movie and will be for a while. The hype is insane and the movie is a great movie because there was all these really bad movies then this movie show up and I was amazed that good movies could still be made. I'm excited what they can do for the next one to make it match the hype.",positive
764,"Into the Spider-Verse made a great change for animated cinema. It was a masterpiece where writers, animators, actors and musicians gave it all to show how Spider-Man inspires us and how animation can be truly art. Now, this sequel somehow manages to surpass the quality that the previous movie delivered. It's just an amazing narration full of color, art experiments, comedy, action and a deeply humane plot. The characters we met before grow in the best way as we follow them through their circumstances. The new ones make themselves memorable and fit into the story without making us lose track on protagonist Miles Morales.The story circles around the question ""Saving one person or saving every world"", creating a complex conflict of humanity and rationality for Spider-Man. This exposes the best side of the character from two different perspectives, as the plot swings from earth to earth perfectly, bringing overwhelming moments, unforgettable characters, nice easter eggs and a great step forward for Spider-Man in animation. It's coherent, intense, funny, dramatic and visually stunning. Solid script and a promising future for the third movie. Spider-Man mythology at its best. Music on point. Perfect casting. Animation, beautiful beyond what words can explain.Also, Spot is amazing.",positive
765,"This is a great film a must watch in my opinion you do need to watch the first to know what is going on though they are both related in my opinion it was not as good as the first one the reason for this is just because how confusing it is the second one has to much going on for my taste in film I would definitely watch it again but if I was to watch the new one that they have given a date for beyond the spider verse I would like them to consider that not everyone likes movies that have to much in them and the cliff-hanger at the end had no point they could have just concluded the film properly instead of trying to make it all awesome and having ""To be continued"" has no worth at all but give your opinion because you might just love it but to me they just have a few more things to do before the next film.",positive
766,"The return of Spider-Man to the big screen with the long-awaited sequel, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"" takes audiences on a new journey through the multiverse. Directed by a trio of talented directors, the film expands upon the beloved world of the fans, offering a fresh perspective on characters and dimensions.At the heart of the story is Miles Morales, the young Spider-Man from Brooklyn, authentically portrayed by Shameik Moore. When Gwen Stacy, also known as Spider-Gwen and played by Hailee Steinfeld, reenters his life with troubling news about the multiverse, Miles embarks on a risky mission that will pit him against new and old enemies.One of the film's strengths lies in the character development, particularly of Miles, as he navigates the challenges of adolescence and heroic duty. His relationship with Gwen adds emotional depth to the plot, without neglecting the typical action of action films.Visually, the film is a spectacle to behold, with breathtaking settings and innovative animation styles that captivate the audience's attention. The directors have created a vibrant and dynamic universe that constantly evolves across different dimensions.Behind the scenes, the film represents a monumental achievement in the field of animation, involving a vast team of professionals. This commitment results in a cohesive and engaging cinematic experience, albeit not without its flaws.Despite its ambitious narrative, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" has some weaknesses, such as a sometimes rushed plot and a finale that leaves some questions unanswered. However, these flaws do not significantly detract from the overall film experience.In conclusion, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a film that offers a good dose of action, emotion, and entertainment. Whether you're a fan of the superhero or simply seeking a night of entertainment, this film is definitely worth considering.",positive
767,"After watching the first movie, my hopes were very low for the second, but surprisingly this move exceeded my expectations. The animations were incredible! The wait was worth waiting for. I felt like the producers did a great job of showing a different side of Miles Morales that we haven't seen before, which made this movie significantly better than the first one. In the future I hope we see more of this side of Miles because I think Miles would make a better anti-hero character than your traditional spider man imo.The only reason I took 2 stars off was because of how disappointing the ending is. So much time wasted and no point of really re-watching it until the third movie is announced. Can't wait for the 3rd movie.",neutral
768,"Ok, look, stop criticizing Hollywood about any lack of originality.Understand, this script was written for youth (9-17 I estimate). The screenplay was marvelously written to sync with them and it does.The animation is incredible. No 3D Pixar or DreamWorks here. The animation was done to mimic comic book pages and is pulled off quite nicely.FUN to watch. Very little if any slow or monotonous minutes. LOTS of storylines going on here yet easy to follow.A little difficult to try and go into explanations here about the plot.The most important thing is it will not disappoint. Very surprising. Pleasantly surprising.",neutral
769,"Best animation I've seen in a decade. I'm waiting for the 3rd spider-verse movie. Across the spider verse is a must watch, whether you're a kid, teenager or an adult.Wonderful animation, nice soundtracks, great sound design. You can see Miles Morales grew up a lot from the first movie(character, height, facial structure, behavior) I can't wait to see how much mature he'll become in the third movie.The storytelling in Across the spiderverse was amazing, thrilling adventure!This is a movie I can watch a thousand times and still enjoy it, and I still can't forget the intro, it's so wonderful.",positive
770,"Spiderman: Across The Verse is nothing short of phenomenal. This film takes the beloved web-slinger into the vast and unpredictable multiverse, delivering an adventure that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant. From its stunning animation to its intricate storytelling, this movie is a visual and narrative masterpiece. Overall, Spiderman: Across The Verse is a must-watch for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. It redefines what a superhero movie can be, blending spectacular visuals with a compelling narrative. This movie is a testament to the enduring legacy of Spiderman and the limitless possibilities of the multiverse.",positive
771,"Just finished watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and it sure is a spectacle. Highlights of the movie were definitely the visuals, and the amazing animation team behind the film have stepped-up their game big time. The vibrant colours, environments, and the mish-mash of a range of styles really reminded me of Everything Everwhere All At Once. The inclusion of the Multiverse feels important and intentional to the story, as it should, which the mainline MCU has had me disappointed with their inclusions in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Spider-Man: No Way Home. The story can feel a little incomplete and unsatisfactory due to the cliffhanger ending, but unlike Fast X, I am even more hyped for Beyond the Spider-Verse coming next March. Most of the main cast and characters have their stories expanded in so many different ways, with a highlight definitely being Gwen Stacy. She was a fan favourite character from the first film, and I've always wanted to see more of her story. Not to mention Miles himself, as we see him grapple with what it means to be Spider-Man. The first hour of the movie took a much slower pace, but a much deserved part of the story so that we can slow down from MCU style visual noise and legitimately get to know and understand our three-dimensional characters. Then again, the pacing felt a bit stilted in the beginning, and felt like it was going to end several times near the end. With the film being almost 2.5 hours long, it can feel like quite some work, even though some of my favourite parts of the movie were when the story took it slow. Also, the story does somewhat suffer from being The Empire Strikes Back of the series, and I just really want to see the characters and their relationships be fully fleshed out (more than I want to see the actual ""story"" per say. But still a brilliant watch nonetheless. Following Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, it's an immense relief to finally see creatives and artists tell a meaningful story with heart and dedication out of the unrelenting slog from Marvel the previous few years. Congratulations to the Spider-Verse team for spinning out such a visually spectacular and truly heartfelt film!",neutral
772,"This takes a little while to get going, and the multiple alternate graphic effects/styles are initially quite jarring. After the first hour I must admit I'd have considered leaving if it wasn't for my lad being with me. It then picked up and the story worked it's way in.I think what is two films will probably have been able to be made in one concise film. I suspect there'll be some greed on show, but hoping the second is a tour de force to prove me wrong. This rescued it as it went along but is still not in the class of the first film. Not far away though and I'm crossing my films they knock it out of the park with the denouement.",neutral
773,"From the animation, story, voice and character acting... This movie is the best Spider-Man movie I've ever seen, maybe even the best superhero movie. At the beginning, I liked Peter Parker way more, because that's the guy I grew up with. But just by watching ""Into the Spider-Verse"", I've gained a high level of respect for Miles Morales, and this sequel just heightened it to a much greater scale. The animation is, yet again, top-level. The voice acting is beautiful, and the character details, with their in-depth personalities are awesome as well. I really liked how this movie portrayed the Spider-Verse and I really liked the new characters that were shown on screen, even those who were shown for just a really short time. As for the story, it kept me interested and on edge for the whole length of the film. I have not thought about anything or taken my eyes off the screen from start to finish. We get drama and suspension already from the start, and then the ending... might be the biggest cliffhanger I've seen. It was very unexpected, and that's why I think the story is excellently written. If I had the time, I'd watch this movie thrice already. I couldn't resist watching it twice, to see if I've missed anything. Beautiful, I expect to see this level of excellence in the last sequel too! I can't wait!",positive
774,"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is an impressive animated film that fits seamlessly into the world of the popular Spider-Man franchise. The film continues the success of its predecessor and once again takes the audience into a fascinating and colorful universe.One of the most notable aspects of the film is undoubtedly its animation. The creators have created a stunning visual landscape that appeals to the senses with its variety of styles and techniques.Another thing is the complexity of the plot, which may be confusing for some viewers. The plot jumps back and forth between different times and dimensions, which may cause some viewers to lose track or have difficulty following what is happening.A major criticism is the lack of a proper ending. The film leaves many storylines open, which may be frustrating for some viewers. It feels more like a teaser for upcoming sequels than a standalone conclusion.",neutral
775,"I honestly could not tell what this movie was trying to be. And they shoved so much into it story wise, it was too much, and then to conclude on a cliffhanger?To be totally honest, for the first 30 minutes for the Gwen part, I was bored. The animation was terrible, and was story just was bland.Then the different worlds were literally like, pick an author, time period, or subject, and we'll make a world/universe out of it. Shakespeare world, Jurassic World, Cowboy word, and they all have a Spiderman.Then there's the whole Canon thing. It was just too much.Overall the animation was just too all over the place. The story was non-sensical in so many areas. I actually only became interested when he got to the ""Spider HQ"", and the chase. But got really quickly annoyed when he ends up in the wrong universe, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I really would rather have my 2 1/2 hrs back.",negative
776,"I was impressed by the art of Into the Spiderverse, and they absolutely stepped it up for Across the Spiderverse. Gwen's universe's art is emotional, engaging, and visually pleasing.I was worried the movie would struggle to introduce so many spider people without them getting buried by each other, but it was executed well, and I think the pals we fell in love with from Into the Spiderverse that didn't have a lot of screen time will have a larger role in Beyond the Spiderverse.Spider-Punk!! ü§òüèºI am beyond excited for Beyond the Spiderverse.

It had a lot of gory and hard to watch scenes which were pretty effective and probably when the film was at its strongest. It also contained a fake-out dream sequence which is my most hated horror trope. For everything this film did well it seemed to do something else to offset it.

780,"The film ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is exceptionally visually pleasing. A sequel to ""Into the Spider-Verse"", the second installation of the series does an amazing job at not only following ""one of the best modern animated movies,"" but some would say it's even better than the first. Directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, this film came out in 2023 and falls into the action animation genre. This film follows the adventures of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, as they travel through different multiverses trying to defeat the villain, ""Spot"". In the mix of traveling, Gwen takes Miles to this Spiderman headquarters where he comes to find out that he is not really welcome there for reasons you will find out when watching. This movie has excellent animation and a good plot that flows throughout the movie and leaves you on a cliffhanger to get you excited and waiting for the next one of the series.When it comes to animation and visuals, this movie is certainly a 10/10. It has the classic comic book animation style while adding many different elements and colors. Due to the nature of the multiverse plotline, different characters from different multiverses have different animation styles. It is so insane to see so many different styles that can fit into one frame. The directors and editors' use of color added so much more to the plot. Between having red hues for the villains, or having certain color pallets for certain characters, the use of colors really allows the audience to have a deeper understanding of what is going on and what the characters' emotions and feelings are. Not only is the animation good, but so is the script and writing. The script allowed for even more character development and growth continuing on from the first film. In the sequel, they introduced the concept of ""canon events"" where basically an event is bound to happen no matter what. The use of this concept is wonderfully tied into the theme of multiverses, which drives most of the plot. Also, the script allowed for many different emotional and or humorous moments throughout the film, which shows its versatility.All in all, I would totally recommend this film to many. It reaches so many different audiences and demographics. You have the Marvel/superhero lovers, the animation lovers, the action lovers, and simply just film lovers in general. It can also reach many different age ranges. The one audience that I could see having a problem with this movie, might be the older audience due to the animation style. Some have complained about the animation being ""too much"" or ""overwhelming"" which can be true for certain people. Despite that, the animation style adds so much to the film and is what I think drives my recommendation up so much. I think this movie is a phenomenal sequel to the first, and will definitely be waiting in anticipation for the next one to follow.",positive
781,"A good movie overall and a good transition to the finale. I liked the character development and all the fan service provided. They did a great job developing Miles and Gwen's characters and back stories. I especially liked the depiction of Miles dad. I'm a father of teenagers myself and he did a great job of balancing responsibility with allowing them to develop and did so without becoming a clown like so many other shows do.Now for the not so great.This movie has no real story of its own. It is a transitional movie but it should also have a story of its own but it really doesn't. All the time is spent on the backstory and leading to the next movie.While Oscar Issac's performance was outstanding, I do not know where they got the personality for Miguel O'Hara. That was not him. I collected the original Spider-Man 2099 comics and he was always my favorite alternate S-Man. What I saw in this movie was not him. Way too serious and way too intense. Miguel has a dark, sardonic sense of humor but he has one. He is also brilliant. None of that came through. He was just a 2D bad guy with a thrown together backstory to justify it. Bad writing all around.I can go above 7 stars for this and honestly my love of the character is the only thing keeping this from a 6. It was good but the next one needs to fix these things.",positive
782,"Into the Spiderverse wrote a new paradigm of animation for Hollywood and many followed. In a true sense it was a milestone movie.

The vision and storytelling is grand. Each frame crafted meticulously with care which only a true fan of the source material can do.Across the Spiderverse is a once in a lifetime movie. And surely will be remembered for changing the world of animation forever.Revolutionary Cinema.",neutral
783,"Because I think this is what this movie essentially is. I got a chance to watch this movie and what I'm about to write is my honest opinion on this movie. I will not say that the people that are calling this a masterpiece are wrong, but rather I'll just question the reasons they do. I think that they are praising this because of the visuals, the songs, the jokes and the gargantuan amount of easter eggs and references. I'm not gonna say that my opinion is the definitive one but I'll rather just express it and challenge the people that are praising this movie to think about what they are praising it for and if they are not praising it for the wrong reasons. Here we go:The movie is set 1 year after Into the Spider-Verse and from the get go it centers as much on Gwen as it does on Miles. I felt this disconnected me somehow from Miles' story considering that also much of the calmer scenes involving Miles and his family were actually repeating the same beats: him being late or not listening to his parents and they grounding him. This in my opinion affected the movie's runtime which felt excruciatingly slow and boring for the first hour or so. Effectively nothing interesting happened that was crucially plot related in the first 35 minutes. It is then that we get our first glimpse into the movie's villain and how he is a danger in the movie. Until then we basically got to know the spider society police department so to say and Gwen and her story which apart from her interaction with her father was pretty boring and uninteresting. Also what bothered me is that from the spider society police department all the main players were either black american or non-american origin. It's like the movie hated the idea of a straight white american male being part of the group. Anyway... they help Gwen fight the vulture which was drawn from another universe because what Miles did in the previous movie somehow cracked the multiverse even though I believe there was no indication for this in that movie. Basically this movie retcons the previous one in order to explain its own existence. Next when the plot eventually picks up the Spot is somehow drawn into the multiverse by kicking himself in his own spots? Like how does that even work? Nah never mind... now this is where the movie gets weird. The spider police including Gwen come into Miles' world to investigate him. Now from what I could watch and understand the Spot appeared after the incident with the Vulture in the beginning of the movie. Aside from the Spot entering the multiverse there is no bad thing that he has done in the multiverse to trigger the spider police to come to Miles' dimension and investigate the Spot. So it's a bit weird that they come in his dimension not knowing from previous incidents of the Spot only to investigate him, which turns out to be the greatest danger in this movie for the spider-verse. Like why investigate him if he never did anything to threaten the spider-verse? Whatever... when all the spider-men excluding Miguel the leader of the police track down the Spot they end up in a dimension where they save a bunch of people but in actuality prevent an event called ""canon event"" as we will later find out. Oh and I forgot to mention the unnecessary detour involving the Spot loosing his spots and them going to the reactor to alter himself back into having spots because he ran out of previous spots for... reasons. This is basically half way through the movie and it feels like the end of the first act and the beginning of the second. This is the first time you actually understand what's at stake here and what our characters will have to stop in this story. Then when Miles and the gang are with Miguel, Peter Parker from the previous movie comes in with his daughter and everything from there on becomes infinitely more cringy. I totally hated what they've done to his character. They actually made him the butt end of all jokes in the movie and gave him the Endgame Thor treatment. We then find out there is going to be another canon event just like the one they prevented involving the Spot and Miles' dad which ends up in the former killing the latter. So naturally Miles escapes hundreds of Spider-men from across the spider-verse and goes back to what he believes to be his dimension, while Gwen goes to his actual dimension. Now I have to admit the scene with him battling Miguel and escaping him is actually intense and quite well executed. However there is no way he could outrun and escape from hundreds of spider-men who all should at least have the same level of abilities as he does. So it would be virtually impossible for him to escape them. Nah whatever... moving on... so the movie ends with Miles and Gwen realizing that he is in the universe from where the spider that bit him came from. Now the reveal and the execution of that scene were fantastic. The disguise of everything and the slow progression and the eventual revelation were done perfectly. The movie however ends with him getting captured by his version from that reality while Gwen gathers a team of the spider-men from the last movie and some from this one to go and find Miles. And of course nothing was resolved or closed but we are rather left with a cliffhanger for the next movie.Now I gotta be honest I expected a phenomenal movie based on the raving reviews it got here and what I actually saw was a rather good flick, slightly better than the Flash. Remember all the good sequels like The Two Towers or The Dark Knight? Remember how a part of the overall story was resolved there while at the same time the next movie was set-up? Well here nothing gets resolved: the Spot is still on his way to kill Miles' dad while Miles is still in the wrong universe and trying to prevent his dad's canon event. In a way I felt robbed from any sort of resolution that would make this movie able to stand on its own and making me actually say ""wow what a nice story"". This movie is no story in it of itself. This movie is just the first half of the whole story. I can only think that the reason this movie is so praised is for the visuals which are astounding and for the many references and humor. I for one didn't maybe catch half of them and as for the humor I never once had a glimmer of laughter on my face while watching this movie. Every single moment of humor was generic 21st century forced Marvel type humor that has to be inserted in every single scene even to the point where it broke the flow of serious and dramatic scenes for a cheap laugh.In conclusion did you enjoy this movie for the character arc of the people in the story? Did you enjoy it for the resolution of some part of the conflict and the set-up of the next part? Or did you enjoy it because of the references, easter eggs or because of the visuals? Because in my opinion there are no character arcs and there are no resolutions but rather only a set-up for the next movie. In fact the intrigue of this movie starts around the 1 hour, 1 hour and 15 minutes mark. Then the action that remains is only 1 hour long and surely has no resolution to nothing that happens in the movie. It's only 1 hour part of the bigger action that will be in the next movie which will then be followed by the resolution. This movie felt like watching the first act and the first half or maybe the first third of the second act, with everything else left for the next movie. It really is like watching half of the full movie.",positive
784,"Its only half a movie...And then we find out its only the first half of the story...Yeah. There is no movie here. The movie is boring. It starts off with gwen telling us in a very boring monotone voice with no music that she and miles have things in common. On and on she goes listing things in that monotone voice. Such a bore straight out of the box.Woah this is a cool, and funny villain. And Wow his powers are awesome. So much could be done with this guy...and hes gone. Hes not in the rest of the movie...All that we can introduce literally 1,000 spiderman characters and then make up some terrible, awful plot line about how they are all after miles. This is where the movie becomes a true snooze fest. Sure, We did get some awesome shots in Indian world, But we stay in indian world for most rest of the movie.The whole time im just waiting for the final fight with spot. 12 minutes left dang how are they going to fit the fight into 12 minutes..and then right when the movie is supposed to end we get some weird and lame twist about how they returned Miles to a different universe for some reason. They really draw this out too. It doesnt work. Yeah,...miles was never supposed to be spiderman...instead...Miles was supposed to get it...or whatever..Nothing is explained here or anything. Instead of ending the movie with a final fight with spot, we are introduced to a new villain. Evil Miles...and its really is such a stupid twist.",negative
785,"As a marvel fan who has been disappointed in the route marvel has been taking I am so grateful for this movie and GOTG V3. Went and saw this in cinemas the day it was released, and wow... the animation was beautiful, the storyline absolutely exciting and miles had brilliant development. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film, and so were most of the others in our cinema. No way home used to be my favourite spidey movie because of the hits of nostalgia, but this knocks it out of the park. Would rate it 9.5 but as that is not possible I will settle for a 9. My only complaint was that there were less original music tracks than the first one, and the villain slightly got on my nerves, but thankfully he wasn't present for too long. I am so excited for beyond the spiderverse, if it is anywhere near as excellent as the first two movies then it will cement the spiderverse trilogy as THE BEST spiderman trilogy.",positive
786,"Just go watch it. I don't have anything else to say, but if you're still not convinced let me list out why.The visuals were stunning. Like its predecessor, it showed how much talent there is and will redefine the standards of animation. Every frame is a masterpiece, a work of art. The team behind the movie are not producers, they are artists and deserve so much praise.Although the the first half was slightly slower paced, the second half really picked up and did justice to the movie. The plot progressed a lot and the action scenes were eye candy.Very few movies put this much love and care into a movie that's supposed to be for ""kids"" but this franchise has turned into a cultural phenomenon and the sequel cements that. It is different and stands out from the crowd of animated movies that try to replicate realism.So my final words: Just go watch it. You WILL love it.",positive
787,"My history with Spider-Man films has been conflicted. There have been moments that I've loved, moments I've disliked and entire films I'd rather forget. As a huge Spider-Man and Peter Parker fan, I've always been critical of what makes it onto the big screen and that has unfortunately made me quite sceptical of anything new Sony, or Marvel, puts out.I honestly never thought the best Spider-Man film would be a Spider-Verse spin off with Miles and Gwen at the helm and have Peter Parker(s) as the supporting act. But here we are and I'm not even a little bit mad about it.Into the Spider-Verse was an incredible film. But now it may have been dethroned by it's sequel. Everything in Across the Spider-Verse is amped up; from the crunchy music to the swathe of new Spider-people crawling and swinging across the screen. It's goofy, it's frantic and the story really grips you by pacing itself expertly throughout the entire 2 hour plus runtime.You have the highs, the laughs, and a touch of potential romance, followed by desperate chases and genuinely mind blowing animated fight scenes. However, some of the best uses of the forever evolving artistic style that the Spider-Verse has become renowned for, take place in the slower, more emotional scenes and are used to visually reflect some truly special moments.When we aren't being hit in the feels, this is a rollercoaster of a film that takes on a lot of new characters in addition to the main cast. Sure it's a risky move, but unlike Spider-Man 3, this definitely paid off. I didn't feel any core character was left in the dark, or needed more exploration or screen time than they had. Plus I loved the brief and crazy appearances of some of the more quirky spiders and it was a joy trying to remember what comic or show each one originated from.I remember when Spider-Gwen first appeared in comics (I treasure my copy of Edge of Spider-Verse 2) and have loved seeing Miles Morales evolve since his own introduction. But man, watching them on screen together is still something else and has surpassed all my expectations. I could never really quite figure why the live action films felt lacking until these two very special animated films were made. They are literally comic books brought to life and Across the Spider-Verse is simply an artistic masterpiece.",positive
788,"FENTASTIC ANIMATED MOVIE. My esteemed colleague Christy Lemire opened her review of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" with a quote from her nine-year-old asking if he could see it again, so I think there's some synergy in quoting my nine-year-old to open this one: ""That might be the best movie I've ever seen.""""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" explodes onto screens this week, building on the foundation of the masterful ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" with stunning animation, unforgettable characters, and complex themes. The first note I took after seeing it was ""so much movie."" Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas. It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great part twos like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Like those films, it leaves viewers anxiously anticipating the next chapter (which will come in March 2024), and it earns its cliffhangers by grounding them in a story of young people refusing to submit to a concept of what a hero's arc needs to be.""Across the Spider-Verse"" opens just over a year after the action of the first movie. Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is back in her universe, trying to keep her identity secret from her father, George (Shea Whigham). When an alternate version of the villainous Vulture (Jorma Taccone) drops into her reality, the bad guy ends up trailed by the intense Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and confident Spider-Woman (Issa Rae). They reveal to Gwen that they're part of a secret Spider-Society that has been cleaning up inter-universe messes, capturing villains who end up in the wrong one and sending them home again. When Gwen's identity is blown with her dad, she joins the Spider-Crew, correcting the errors of multi-verse.Of course, fans will remember that Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is essentially one of those errors. The Peter Parker of his universe died trying to save him, and the spider that bit Miles was never supposed to be there. But it was. So now what? This story's backbone is about pushing back against determinism and moving forward with what's in front of you. Superhero culture has used multiverse stories to expand on the concept of potential, but this film (and I hope these themes really land in its sequel) suggests that it's way more important to hold onto the reality in your hands than imagine all of the other ones that might have been. It's about controlling your own fate more than giving into a scripted narrative of heroism. More than most superhero movies, it's about empowerment instead of destiny. And that's powerful stuff.",neutral
789,"After the first movie and seeing how highly praised from both critics and fans, this follow up sequel was certainly heavily anticipated as expected. Both films are great in the true sense. This follow up does do certain things slightly different but is quite unique in its own sense.The visuals are just as great, if not more diverse. Where it feels like an art gallery turned into a film. Where we are watching and it seems too much to notice but as we continue watching, we notice every little detail that seemingly went into the film's animation and artwork.The conclusion is of course left off at a cliffhanger where not many people expected with an ending that doesn't definitely end. Which only brought up further excitement for the third film.Several highlights, including the chase scene with Miles trying to leave that universe with the other Spider-man all seemingly chasing him on the moving sub at train. The different animations and textures of the work in this scene is outstanding as a whole.The story is more mysterious this time around where the final twenty minutes were incredibly intriguing and left the viewers wanting more. Seeing how Miles accidentally transported into the wrong universe with him slowly realizing it was quite engaging.The villain of Spot was a unique touch added in. Preferably most aren't aware of his creation but he definitely brought something different.As a whole very well done. The third film will certainly be heavily anticipated as pressure going forward will only increase.",positive
790,"This movie is a masterpiece i thought it couldn't get better after the first one i was wrong. When i sat down in the cinema my hopes were high and this movie made me ascend and start floating in the cinema. The plot twist at the end was crazy tho. I will not stop thinking about this movie for a few months hence years. Massive thanks to Sony, Marvel and Stan Lee for the possibility for me to feast my eyes on this movie. I am forever grateful for this once in a lifetime opportunity. I will not be at rest until the sequel to this movie is released i will be booking tickets to the first showtime and getting there 5 hours early. Thank you Spider man.",positive
791,"Fans of the first ""Into the Spider-verse"" movie should like seeing Miles Morales return to the big screen in a fun and action packed story.... only he's not the focus of the movie half the time, Gwen Stacy is. The Creators really should have given Spider Gwen her own stand alone movie before making ""Across the Spider-verse"", so they wouldn't have had to sideline Miles Morales, the main character, so much.Other then that, the hyper-stylization is cranked up to 50, the action swings around so dizzyingly fast you barely even have a moment to see it, and the banter never stops. Never.That said, this is a good movie, I had a lot of fun watching it, it is obvious the Creators put a lot of effort into this movie and the actors are great. The interactions between Miles, Gwen, and their families are heart felt. I do recommend seeing this movie, just pointing out some of the flaws.",positive
792,"This movie is hella good man!!!!!!!!!My boy Miles oh my god, he is amazing mate. The animation, the characters, the artist, the actors(voice) are so damn good man. Totally worth it. Sony just dropped the best Spider Man movie ever. No cap!!!And the music, shout out to Metro Boomin my homie, You just killed it my man. I'm listening those music all the day mate...Overall this is the best movie ever in the halfway of 2023.Oh I almost forgot to mention my boy Hobie and Pavitra Pravakar. These characters mate so well decorated with my boy Miles. The connection, the chemistry between them, my goodness it just so amazing and pleased to watch.I was excited whole time watching this movie like 2 hour 15 minute or something..You mate just go to theater and watch this movie. You ain't gonna bore if you are really a Spider man fan.",positive
793,"I looove the first Spiderverse movie, and I read the comics back when they were coming out-- but this movie feels a bit tame or even cookie-cutter-ish compared to the first. The art is still amazing and inspired, the voice acting: superb, but for how long this movie is, I felt like I wanted more plot development than what I got. I think this might be in-part due to this movie focusing more on Gwen, but I didn't hate her development or any of the twists this movie brought about.If anything, I think this movie serves as a refresh for viewers: get back into the Spiderverse, jog your memory a bit, and then set up the story so that the third installment will be absurdly awesome. (Just my theory!) I still really enjoyed watching, it just felt more like an appetizer when I had wanted a meal, y'know?",positive
794,"Waste of time and money. What a joke. It took forever to spin the story, meaning the first 2 hours of the movie were pretty much unnecessary and then because it took so long to get to the point it stops abruptly and leaves you hanging. All this hype about the animation and VFX are crap. Yeah maybe it felt like living in a comic book at times but it didn't cut it for me. Believe characters someone said. Are you kidding me? What 15 year olds do you know that are out saving the universe. The only believable characters were the ones who weren't the super heros. This is the same old same old story. The bad guy reveals himself and the good guy is out to stop him. Tosing in a few complications like crossing multi universes doesn't make it better and it's been done before. Sometimes successfully sometimes not so much. This time not so much. Honestly if this is the future of animation and super hero movies it will be my last. Like I said in the beginning waste of time and money mine and the people who created it. Back to the drawing board folks.",negative
795,"This movie was an absolute masterpiece and is the best movie I have ever watched. The animation is amazing and even better than the previous film. All the different animation styles were amazing and so beautifully done. The movie's different tones and colour schemes are just amazing, and the shift from light to dark near the end of the film is just amazing. All the scenes are very visually pleasing to see. This film was overstuffed with characters, but unlike any other movie that has this issue, this movie executed each character perfectly and had amazing character development for all the major characters, despite most of them not being included in the first film. The dialogues are funny and well-written. The voice acting is amazing, and full of emotion. The plot is one of the best plots from any movie I have ever watched, live-action or animated; it is well constructed and has a very decent twist near the end. The pacing of the movie is also, generally, good throughout the film.",positive
796,"I absolutely hate when a movie exists solely to be part 1 of a 2 part movie. I'm not talking about a complete movie, with plenty of room for a sequel like the first one. I am talking about a 4-5 hour story, broken up in 2 parts and released a year apart. Some don't even have 4-5 hours of material, they just stretch out each movie so they can make it 2 movies. Even if you make one story a 2 part event, spaced a year apart, at least conclude the movie you set up. Don't make the first of a 2 part movie be all setup, and raised stakes, and then just end it on a cliffhanger. This is so obviously a studio move, to capitalize on as much money as possible. Much like how Tarantino wanted Kill Bill to be one movie with an intermission, but the studio wanted it to be 2 parts, released a year apart. They always do this with popular movies too. They started this in the early 2000's with the Matrix sequels and Kill Bill. Lord of the Rings is an exception where I agree with this strategy. They did it with The Hobbit, which did not work. They also did it with Twilight, and Hunger Games, another mistake. Anyone who has seen Kill Bill as one movie will tell you it should have stayed one movie. Part 2 was so boring compared to part 1. The whole movie together, while long, is so much better, and doesn't have that cheesy direct to camera narration in part 2. ...but the studios wanted the most money. If you look at the track record of this, it's rarely a good idea. Make a complete movie, and follow it up with another complete movie. Don't make people wait 5 years to see a sequel, only to give us 1/2 a movie, and wait a year for the second half. Don't get me wrong, this movie was really well done, but I wanted a whole movie.",negative

798,"After watching the first instalment I could not see how it could ever be matched never mind bettered and I was worried entering the cinema that I would be leaving disappointed, However in one of the very rare events the second movie has been an equal at least of its hugely popular predecessor. The actions scenes were immense, the story in itself tragic, heroic, romantic and this is a animated movie! I have a debate with my father as to which spiderman movie is the best and he believes it has to be Tom Holland portraying spiderman because it's actors having to play the role whereas animated movies are basically comics in 3D but I see way past that, I see the beauty of the work, I understand the time and effort of making each character relatable likeable and believe it's just as hard as actors having to act out roles. Definitely my favourite Spiderman movies are Into the spider verse and Across the Spider verse.",neutral
799,"*""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse""* is an exhilarating ride that masterfully builds upon its predecessor, offering a visually stunning and emotionally rich experience. As a follow-up to the groundbreaking *Into the Spider-Verse,* this sequel takes everything that worked in the original and cranks it up to eleven, delivering a movie that is both ambitious and deeply personal.The animation remains a standout, blending various art styles to create a vivid, dynamic world that feels like a comic book come to life. Every frame is packed with detail, making each scene a visual feast. The film's diverse animation styles are not just for show-they serve the narrative, reflecting the different universes and their unique energies.The story dives deeper into the multiverse concept, expanding the Spider-Verse in exciting ways. It introduces new characters, like Spider-Man 2099 and Spider-Punk, each bringing their own flair and significance to the plot. The themes of identity, belonging, and responsibility are explored with nuance, particularly through Miles Morales, who continues to be an incredibly relatable and likable protagonist.However, the movie's ambition sometimes works against it. The plot can feel a bit overloaded, juggling numerous characters and storylines, which occasionally makes the pacing uneven. Some sequences are so packed with action and detail that they can be overwhelming, potentially leaving viewers struggling to keep up with the narrative's many moving parts.Additionally, while the film ends on a high note, it leaves several threads unresolved, setting the stage for the next installment. This open-ended conclusion might frustrate those who were hoping for a more self-contained story.Overall, *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* is a triumphant sequel that pushes the boundaries of what animated films can achieve. It's a visual marvel with a lot of heart, even if it occasionally stumbles under the weight of its own ambition. For fans of the first movie and Spider-Man enthusiasts in general, this is a must-see that earns a solid 8/10.",neutral

It is a beautiful movie with an incredible amount of attention to detail.The 5 years spent waiting for this movie was not spent in vain. This is worthy of every Oscar they are capable of handing out to an animated movie.

I get that it is supposed to be continued in the next movie, but usually a 2 part-er has some form of resolution to keep you satisfied. This movie just sets up multiple things and leaves them for another movie to finish. I feel like the greatness of this movie hinges on the greatness of the conclusion in the next film. IMO this isn't better than the first, the story hasn't finished. The movie pulls you along wondering how all these new plot points resolve and then 'to be continued shows up'. :(",positive
803,"I am the biggest Spider-Man fan, I loved the first movie and I was truly disappointed by the sequel. The multiple story lines are not connected and nothing is resolved in the movie, the cliffhanger ending is not much of a cliffhanger. The unusual romantic dialogue at the beginning adds nothing to the movie. This move was 2 hours and 20 minutes long, the first hour should have been completely deleted. The last 1 hour and 20 minutes was a decent attempt at a Spider-Man movie. During the first hour was falling asleep. Hopefully the third movie is written by the writer of the Original award winner.",neutral

The film expands on the visual innovation of the first installment, incorporating a plethora of artistic styles and techniques to create a vibrant, ever-shifting visual tapestry.

The characters have me attached and I love the way they interact with each other. The spider-mans being aware of all the different universes definitely drives a lot of feelings and behaviors and is interesting to see. Not to mention the animation is just beautiful.

808,"To be honest this is easily one of the best superhero movies. The reason for that is the style of animation they use, same as the first one but it's different. I know that sounds confusing but the way they show emotion with colors. It's like you are sitting in bedroom reading the comics and watching the comics come to life. You see the emotions come to life and that's something that a lot of marvel movies don't do a lot. Also the soundtrack is just such a good vibe. It's long and the ending might annoy you but just remember this, go into the movie like an 8 year old kid coming back from the comic book store ready to read that new comic. I promise you you will enjoy the movie.",positive

Every other Spider-Person has their own tone in the movie that keeps them together and still gives a unique identity to all. The chaos in it has an upwards graph with comedy, action, surprises and adventure up until the end giving out some epic addition of characters whom you will crave more for.Pavitr Prabhakar & Hobie Brown if not the show, steal the limelight whenever on screen.Has the right mixture of balanced emotions, music and drama, which will leave you in awe, with homages to some classic and fanning over some new soon-to-be favourite characters. Held a forward momentum across the movie and the spider-verse, will be fun to see where they take it from here.Sum up - It's one big web with all itsy bitsy spiders crawling by the walls, down comes The Spot and washed the spiders out.A definite blast to watch for each and every Spidey fan and a true love letter to the comic book genre.",positive

811,If i wasnt watching with subtitles i wouldnt have heard a single word...music in every scene....super loud i dont understand that except to say they probably did it to hide the lack of excitement for most of first half of the movie ....opening scene very repetative....this movie lacked subtle ...bigger and crazier and louder isnt always better....ok i guess i need to say more so ill say this why is it that all these other versions of spiderman have a cop in the family yet peter parker didnt. And if this is an infinite time lines thing how is it that there is an newyork in india or that india somehow settles in america? But somehow is still a newyork version ...its insane multiverse or no it seems far fetched.Ok have to add ...i didnt care for animation in first but it grew on me but this one seems to stretch the lines of blurry even further its hard to watch ....the plot sucks the characters are not nearly as good as the first ....AND wtf is with gwens dad lying ? Really your gonna try and arrest your daughter for lying.....he didnt say how could you kill peter !!!!.....no he say how long have you been lying what a dumb way to insert drama between the two of them ....ill add more later.,positive
812,"This film stands out as a cinematic gem, seamlessly blending innovative animation with a captivating storyline. The film's visual style is a visual feast, offering a fresh and dynamic take on the superhero genre.Beyond that, I felt this film had definitely resonated with me and this is why: find our identity, embrace our uniqueness, and defy those who seek to define us.The film intricately weaves a tapestry of self-discovery and fate, drawing parallels to the hero's journey seen in ancient myths and Joseph Campbell's narrative arc. The film goes beyond conventional superhero identity narratives, shedding light on marginalized aspects of identity, notably exemplified in the poignant moments between Miles Morales and his mother, Rio.In the face of societal decay and disapproval, the movie presents a modernist perspective, encapsulated by Rio's powerful message-never let anyone dictate your existence or undermine your sense of belonging. This echoes a metamodernist approach, capturing the oscillating nature of identity contradictions in our complex world, encompassing aspects like ethnicity, class, gender, nationality, and more.The metaphorical spiderweb becomes a powerful symbol, reflecting our entanglement with multiple facets of self, where seemingly disparate identities must find connection. The film invites us to bridge the gaps within ourselves and reconcile conflicting aspects before they consume our world. I find that beautifully illustrated, which is why I'm fond of Hobie/Spider-Punk, and I'll get to that later.The film emphasizes that, despite our differences, we hold the key to shaping the future and addressing the challenges that lie ahead. It prompts viewers to ask themselves, in the words of the movie, 'Will you?' Ultimately, the movie becomes a call to action, a testament to the power we hold in steering the course of our lives and shaping the destiny that is uniquely ours.So, Hobie. My man, Hobie. Love him, who wouldn't? Hobie's character shines as a beacon of staying true to oneself. His independence is evident as he continues saving people aligned with the Spider Society's interests, not out of obligation. Hobie's absence at a crucial event highlights his belief in letting others make their own choices.In a defining moment, he takes a refreshing approach, avoiding confrontation. Instead of dictating, he empowers Miles with the ""Use your palms, not just your fingers"" advice, emphasizing the power to decide one's fate. Hobie's unique portrayal makes him an enabler of authenticity, embodying the film's theme of embracing individuality and autonomous decision-making. So, Hobie. My man, Hobie. Love him, who wouldn't?",positive
813,"From the film's opening scene about Gwen's past, the film was great. I enjoyed how they opened the film with her origin story instead of Miles straight away.The animation of ASV is absolutely stunning (it makes the film) and even better than ISV. In terms of music I would have to say that ISV was better but with the album coming out tonight I'll have to see if I change my mind as I did hear a couple during the film that sounded really great.Although some may be frustrated that the film ends on a cliff-hanger, this is something we were already told and I can't wait for BSV in March of next year.",positive
814,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an exciting two-part movie. The animation is absolutely mind-blowing, creating a visual experience like no other. The soundtracks are phenomenal, perfectly complementing the action-packed scenes. The film is filled with cleverly hidden easter eggs in every frame, so keep your eyes peeled.While the movie introduces numerous characters, the limited runtime doesn't allow for a deep exploration of each one. However, the primary characters are well-developed and engaging. The fast-paced narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat, constantly questioning your favourite characters and fan theories are bound to blow up. The plot promises to deliver explosive twists and turns, leaving a lasting impression.Overall, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a must-watch that lives up to the legacy of its predecessor. It's a thrilling and unforgettable cinematic experience that will have you eagerly anticipating the second part. It's definitely a great watch.",neutral

The characters are so damn good and well written that actually makes you feel the characters struggle in this movie despite seeing them as a fictional characters. With so much emotional moments, great cameos and a lot of stuff that I can't catch up to describe.

It builds upon the freshness of the first film and takes it even further, and that itself is an amazing feat.Let's talk about the soundtrack - it's simply jaw-droppingly good. Every track, every tune, every theme had me thinking, ""Damn, this goes hard!"" The cyberpunk-esque style meshes perfectly with the multiversal travel and the various art styles. They know their styles well and effortlessly incorporate them into the film, whether it's noir, punk, Bollywood, cyberpunk, or metropolitan. The movie bursts with a gusto that is rare to find.The references throughout the film showcase a profound understanding of Spider-Man's roots and comic books. Every frame feels like a painting, and every corner is filled with delightful Easter eggs. It's clear that the creators have a genuine love for their craft, the origins of the character, and the fundamental formula of Spider-Man.The runtime runs, and before I knew it, it was over. While, the plot is not as tight as the previous movie, it's more creative, but with one caveat. It's painfully incomplete. I did not know that this was a two-parter, and watching the ending, repeated the experience I had with Avengers again. But I'm excited, and I'm in love, and that's a sign of a great movie.Each character is given ample depth, making them feel just as fleshed out as the titular character. The movie places a strong emphasis on family, which will tug at the heartstrings of anyone watching. Additionally, the theme of choosing your own destiny and defying societal expectations is explored, offering a compelling and powerful idea. Although not fully realized here, I have high expectations that it will be brilliantly executed in the complete story.The film throws an abundance of jokes, understanding that even if just one lands, it surpasses the plenitude of comedies that try too hard to not fail.Spider-Gwen plays a more important role in this movie, essentially starting and completing the coda of the movie. The movie seems to complete her arc as she assembles her band.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" effortlessly captures the audience with its stunning visuals, exhilarating action, and pure fun. It's evident that an immense amount of effort has been poured into every frame, making it a true visual spectacle. I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes my all-time favorite movie - a realization I certainly didn't expect. And despite the story beats being as familiar as time itself, it still remains to be one of the most innovative movies of recent times.",positive
817,"Wow, I was so amazed by this movie I watched it twice in two days. I liked the first movie. I loved the sequel. I can't wait for part three.""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" picks up with Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) a couple of years older, in a new suit, and killin' the Spider-Man thing. Being Spider-Man has its drawbacks though. He's been missing school and his tardiness to different events has caused a strain between him and his parents, Jeff and Rio Morales (voiced by Brian Tyree Henry and Luna Lauren Velez).A rather innocuous battle with a villain named Spot (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) made Miles late to his father's retirement party which was the straw that broke the camel's back. His parents were fed up with Miles' behavior and his lame excuses.Before the movie jumped into Miles' story we got a glimpse of Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld) and what she was going through in her universe. She was having an even tougher time as her father, George (voiced by Shea Whigham), believed that she (as Spider-Woman) was responsible for the death of her best friend. She was saved from handcuffs by Miguel O'Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), the leader of an inter-universe Spider-beings legion that was responsible for preventing anomalies in the various universes. It was a big deal.Miles found himself at the HQ of the inter-universe Spider-Beings legion though he was uninvited. Things only got more dramatic from there.I was so deeply engaged in this movie I couldn't tell you if I was breathing or not. I'm sure I didn't blink. The movie got better and better as it went along. It was far deeper than I ever expected it to be and tons more entertaining. The storyline is perfection and some of the best writing I've ever seen from a comic book superhero movie.Some people have complained about the animation style. I say, ""Oh ye of little knowledge and appreciation."" The animation, which was a blend of various styles, was brilliant. Every style was a version of comic book illustration. Hobie (voiced by Daniel Kaluuya), who was Spider-Punk, wasn't even animated, he was a still illustration drawn in different poses and different positions and yet he was one of my favorites!I had zero complaints. Even the ending only made me pine for more. And Spot, that seemingly weak villain... yeah, even he got more awesome as the movie progressed. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man collection and it has supplanted many of the existing Spider-Man movies.",positive
818,"Gotta say, I was hyped af for this and the hype after 5 years was deserved. Story opens up with Gwen and her backstory, this part of the movie is really important for character development, now we see miles which he's just being a friendly neighborhood Spiderman, don't wanna go deeper into the story. Every scene of this film felt special as everything was specifically animated, and I gotta give props to Hobbie of how he's changing colours. At the start we meet Miguel which is one of my favorite Spidermans, and lastly the twist at the and was INSANE, maybe a little downside of this movie is the cliffhanger at the end but we know marvel so I'm not actually that mad. 10/10 easily.",neutral
819,"When I went to watch the first spider-verse movie, I had no expectation. It was a total surprise and I was blown away.I had very high hope before watching this new one. Maybe I had too much expectation. I was completely let down.Now I understand why some of the reviewers saying this movie is a money-grab.The opening was good, followed by OK beginning of 30 minutes, and then it started very dragging. Too much unnecessary scenes and repeated, long, and boring dialogues. I yawned so many times in the middle.The fighting was honestly not exciting, the conflict and dynamic between characters were dull, the worst part was, after 2 hours and 20 minutes, I realize the story was not even finished!How unnecessary! Honestly, they could compress this movie into 1 hour 45 minutes, and it would probably be much better by cutting some scenes. Keeping the 3rd movie. Or, they could have make it 2 hour 20 minutes but finish telling the whole story!I was honestly mad after walking out.",negative
820,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is the sequel to the 2018 animated superhero film ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"". Featuring the voices of Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, it takes this series in a much darker direction without ever relenting on the fantastic animation and important character development.More than a year after the events of the first film, Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is still fighting crime in his respective universe as the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. One day, Miles encounters a dangerous new foe calling himself ""The Spot"" (voiced by Jason Schwartzman), whose powers allow him to travel through different universes instantly. During the fight, Miles is soon joined by his love interest Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld), who informs him of The Spot's true intentions of destroying the entire multiverse of Spider-People. After The Spot evades capture, Miles agrees to accompany Gwen to the Spider-Society, where he learns that all of the various Spider-People have differing opinions on how to deal with The Spot's destructive plans.It feels like such a long time ago that ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" seemingly came out of nowhere and blew us away with its incredible art style, great writing, and memorable characters. In actuality, it has only been five years since then, but given the far reach of its appeal and the impact it has left on audiences, I suppose it appears much longer. As is usually the case with anything this popular, it is inevitable that discussions of a sequel will arise, with numerous possibilities of what direction it could follow. Now in ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"", we get to see the combined stories of both Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy in a follow-up that contains all of what made its predecessor so great in the first place and more.Aside from ramping up its already impressive visuals, the film places a strong emphasis on developing each of its lead characters even further than before. We learn more about how Miles is dealing with his double life as a superhero and as a teenager trying not to flunk high school. He is conflicted over wishing to protect his universe from crime while simultaneously wanting to avoid disappointing his parents when his grades start slipping. On that note, the film reminds us that Miles has one notable thing over Peter Parker, being that both of his parents are alive and well. The film does a great job showcasing not only Miles's point of view, but also the perspectives of his mother and father. Both of them love their son dearly but are unaware of his superhero secret identity, causing him to become emotionally distant from them. I really enjoyed seeing how the film focused on Miles's frequent moral dilemmas, with him reacting the way any teenager would with what must feel like the weight of the world on his shoulders. Though this did allow for some comedic situations to take place, never once is Miles's emotional state played for laughs.Likewise, we also get to see how much Gwen Stacy has changed since the original film. Although her confidence in her abilities remain the same, Gwen is now at odds with deciding whether she should protect her friend Miles or focus on the mission given to her by the Spider-Society. Although it is ambiguous as to whether or not she is in love with Miles, it's safe to say that she deeply cares about him regardless. There is a lot at stake with the threat of the entire universe falling victim to The Spot, and Gwen is forced into an ultimatum of either working together with Miles or with the other members of the Spider-Society. What makes things particularly interesting is watching the intertwining decision-making that Miles and Gwen are often subjected to throughout the story. For instance, Gwen is clearly concerned about Miles but cannot bring herself to go through with what would be best for the whole Spider-Verse, whereas Miles, upon learning the truth of the matter at hand, struggles to figure out the best course of action to take that will satisfy all parties. I was impressed with how well the film handled both Miles and Gwen's moral compasses, which adds a necessary level of depth to their characters, and in turn, provides riveting drama to the overall plot.Even if you aren't fully invested in the story (not that you wouldn't be anyway), the film's amazingly diverse visuals makes it near-impossible to look away from. Just like its predecessor, we witness so many different combinations of animation at play, ranging from classic rotoscoping, modern CG art, and even something that wouldn't look out of place in a Leonardo da Vinci painting. One thing that they do have in common is that they all simulate the reading of a comic book, complete with onomatopoeia and rectangular framing on certain scenes. No two universes look alike, and it's difficult for me to choose an art style I liked the most to single out as my favourite. Yet despite the abundance of all these unique looking places, by some miracle everything flows so seamlessly that nothing ever feels cluttered. The editing is handled flawlessly, with no scenes that invoke boredom or anything distracting to the plot. I can't imagine the painstaking lengths this film's animation team went to make this film look as jaw-dropping as possible but they deserve a great deal of respect for all that they have done.All of the voice acting is first rate, with Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld each bringing a valuable amount of believability to their characters. Moore's dramatic performance as Miles has evolved considerably since the first film. While I thought he did a nice job in the original, I think he shone the most during that film's comic relief scenes, playing into Miles's awkward teenager traits. This time, we see Miles dealing with more serious matters, and it is here we get to see Moore's range as a actor. There were several moments where I could tell that Moore was really putting his heart and soul into his performance, which helped me feel so much more attached to Miles's character. I'm willing to call this a signature role for Moore, at least until we get a live-action Miles Morales Spider-Man film.Equally deserving of praise is Hailee Steinfeld as the voice of Gwen Stacy, who like Moore, has shown noticeable growth since last time. Though she still retains her wisecracking, sarcastic personality, Gwen is now in a more vulnerable state due to a conflict of interest. She realises how valuable Miles is to her as both an asset and a friend, which often ends up clouding her better judgement. You can tell that Steinfeld is ensuring she makes Gwen highly sympathetic to the audience, and to that effect she succeeds with flying colours. This film is just as much Gwen's story as it is Miles's, and to see such a perfect balance struck between the two is nothing short of wonderful.With the bar already set so high, it comes as a surprise that this long-awaited sequel is able to keep up the pace with its predecessor to such a degree. In terms of emotional weight and visuals, I consider this film to be superior, much like how ""The Dark Knight"" is regarded by many to be better than ""Batman Begins"". Another follow-up, titled ""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"", is due for release in 2024 to continue this story even further. Additionally, there is also Spider-Woman spin-off film in development so it looks like ""Spider-Man"" fans have plenty of content to look forward to in the future. Until then, I have faith that the filmmakers will deliver the goods once again.I rate it a solid 9/10.",positive
821,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is an absolute masterpiece that deserves every single one of these ten stars, and then some! This film takes the brilliance of its predecessor and propels it to new dimensions, quite literally. From its breathtaking animation to its heart-pounding storytelling, this sequel proves that lightning can strike twice.The animation style is mind-blowing, a stunning blend of comic book aesthetics and cutting-edge technology that brings every frame to life with dynamic energy. The vivid colors, the attention to detail, and the seamless integration of different artistic techniques create a visual feast that's unlike anything seen before in cinema.But it's not just the visuals that shine - the story is equally captivating. The multiverse concept is masterfully explored, weaving together multiple Spider-People from different dimensions in a way that's both exhilarating and emotionally resonant. The character development is top-notch, giving us a deeper look into the struggles, growth, and determination of each Spider-Person.The voice acting is exceptional across the board. Returning favorites and new additions all deliver performances that breathe life into their characters, making us feel every emotion, every triumph, and every setback. The chemistry and camaraderie between the different Spider-People are infectious and heartwarming.The action sequences are a sheer delight, combining acrobatics, superpowers, and creative choreography to create scenes that are not only thrilling but also visually inventive. These sequences are a testament to the creativity and dedication of the filmmakers, as they make us feel like we're right there swinging through the multiverse alongside these heroes.The film's pacing is spot-on, managing to balance its action-packed moments with quieter, introspective scenes that allow us to connect with the characters on a deeper level. And that ending... oh, that ending! It's a rollercoaster of emotions that leaves us eagerly anticipating the next installment.In summary, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a monumental achievement in filmmaking. It's a symphony of creativity, storytelling, and technical prowess that delivers a cinematic experience that will be remembered for years to come. Whether you're a die-hard Spider-Man fan or simply someone who appreciates exceptional cinema, this film is an absolute must-see. Prepare to be amazed, inspired, and thoroughly entertained.",positive
822,"The sheer volume of different artistic styles is astonishing and the fact they manage to seamlessly blend them with CGI and live action is superb. Great music, fantastic animation that conveys a real sense of movement and plenty of humour and imaginative variations of Spider-Man. The plot is entertaining and balances the personal with the big threats, the characters are fun, the villain is atypical if a bit underdeveloped and the settings were good, although not as varied as they could have been. It is a bit too long as it repeats the same themes and the cliffhanger ending felt odd when an extra 20 minutes could have wrapped it all up, but I can understand why they want another film to be made.",positive
823,"""Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go. Nah. I'm-a do my own thing""Rarely do we experience movies of this stature, films of this kind that effortlessly transport you to their own dimensions, to their universe, they immerse you and your deep-lying subconscious to a level when you start to lose track of time, you begin to lose yourself, all the characters, all the events, the whole world feels like a newfound home, a place of hopes, a place to take shelter, one that you do not want to let go of, from where you do not want to come back ever.Films like these make me fall in love with cinema again and again. Films like these provide you with the kind of experience that lingers long; I won't ever forget it, I don't want to.An Epitome of Animation movies, period.",positive
824,"3 Writers. 3 Directors. A 2h 20m run-time (yeah, it's the longest animated film produced by an American studio ever). Yet, this is right up there among the best comic book films ever made. I was already astonished by the sheer magic of blending 2D & 3D elements in the first film, and this one takes it up several notches to showcase one of the most visually dazzling films you'll ever see. Yeah, I'm using a lot of superlatives here but I honestly can't help. Across the Spider-Verse stretches the boundaries of animation in an industry that's fearful of the its growing dependence on generative AI. But can anyone deny the human essence that's keeping it all together? This is what I'd call a WORK of ART. Apparently, if you're a keen observer, you'll notice six different animation styles used throughout the film (whereas most such films have one).The makers figured out a distinct animation style for each of its central characters and the design/tech teams worked over the years to make it happen. The styles switch between different universes, yet everything looks cohesive. Every shot is so vibrant and wallpaper-like, and the hand-drawn quality of it is something to marvel at (pun intended!). We have way too many Spiderpeople in this film, and that's not a rub on the storytelling in any way. It's infact one of its core strengths. With Phil Lord and Christopher Miller part of the writing team, I did have pretty high hopes on the routes they'd take. The storytelling payoffs with such diverse protagonists are absolutely brilliant, if I were to summarise.The soundtrack choices are fantastic once again, and Daniel Pemberton's score is one of the film's essential ingredients. Shots even include cross-property interactions, which is a total delight when it's done in good taste. And in this case, IT IS! I was getting a bit tired out by almost every big superhero film going the multiverse/parallel dimensions route, but here's one film where that's put to superb effect. The voiceover cast also does a tremendous job. Above all of it, the animation work is goading the entire industry to push further and further. That's a wholesome achievement in itself. I can't wait to see the third instalment rake in a lot of money at the box office and receive unanimous critical appreciation.",positive
825,"I have given 10 out of 10 stars to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the sequel to the Oscar-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. In this spoiler-free review, I will tell you why this film is a must-watch for all fans of the web-slinging hero and his multiverse counterparts.The film picks up a year after the first one, where Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is still adjusting to his life as Spider-Man in Brooklyn. He is contacted by Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld), who needs his help to stop a new threat that could destroy all the universes of Spider-People. Along the way, they meet a new team of Spider-People, known as the Spider-Society, led by Miguel O'Hara (voiced by Oscar Isaac), the Spider-Man of 2099. However, they also clash with each other on how to deal with the villain, who turns out to be the Spot (voiced by Jason Schwartzman), a young scientist who accidentally gained the ability to create portals across dimensions.The film is a visual feast, with stunning animation that showcases different styles for each of the six universes visited by the characters. The action scenes are thrilling and inventive, with creative use of the portals and the spider-powers. The humor is witty and charming, with references to various Spider-Man media and pop culture. The soundtrack is catchy and diverse, featuring songs from different genres and artists.But what makes the film truly special is its heart and soul. The film explores the themes of identity, responsibility, friendship, and love, through the eyes of Miles and his fellow Spider-People. Each of them has their own struggles and motivations, but they also learn from each other and grow as heroes and individuals. The film also pays tribute to the legacy of Spider-Man, honoring his past, present, and future incarnations.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece of animation and storytelling, that will delight and inspire audiences of all ages. It is a worthy successor to the first film, and a celebration of everything that makes Spider-Man such a beloved and iconic character. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Spider-Man, animation, or just great cinema in general.",positive
826,"I'm trying to figure out how anyone gave this a 10. It's not even a movie... it's a non-stop slew of cameos, with no actual plot.The stop-motion animation detracts significantly from quality, to save on $$ by rendering fewer frames. Mix in *way* too much hand-doodles of the same quality that parents hang up on their fridge. Throw in an extra *extra* helping of comic book cut-out seizure inducing flashes. It's a hodge-podge puddle of goop that says nothing and goes nowhere.It's got *some* interesting bits, and some funny bits... but nothing that holds it all together.This should have been a TV series, not a movie without a plot/ending.",neutral
827,"Like several other movies in the post-COVID, back-to-theaters era, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was met with prodigious praise and excitement. The reviews were in ecstasy, one of the most eye-popping being that of Houston Coley on Twitter: ""I kept waiting for that sequel moment where I'd go 'Yeah, this is cool, but it just doesn't have the same lightning in a bottle as the original.' That moment never came. This movie is a whole brewery of lightning in bottles."" (It is also the highest-rated film on Letterboxd, alongside Elem Klimov's Come and See. Movie marathon, anyone?)So not only was this film supposedly better than 2018's Into the Spider-Verse, but many times over. I suppose this was one of two options. When trailers revealed that we'd be seeing even more Spider-People than before, each hailing from their own reality with its own distinct animation style, I foresaw two possibilities:Either this will be a sequel that tries to repeat a clever idea but tips over the ""too much"" line (into the ""cluttered mess"" territory that its predecessor narrowly avoided), or a masterpiece of unmitigated creativity and imagination the likes of which we've yet to see -- even in the singularly liberating medium of animation. Well, I'd say we pretty much got the latter.What a hypnotic film. What a demonstration of the various looks we can achieve through animation. And what a precise, seamless way of recreating, then blending them all. And what a relief that this isn't just ""a whole lot of Spidey stuff"" that will please devoted geeks who want nothing more than ""more"" -- although it will certainly please them -- but also a work of art that explores why people admire Spider-Man so (as they should continue to do, even when someone ""different"" adopts the mantle) and what it is within this mythos that speaks to us. Will you get your cameos? Sure you will. But you'll also get to see them used in a way that works well narratively and thematically.The film re-unites Miles ""Spider-Man"" Morales (Shameik Moore), Gwen ""Spider-Woman"" Stacey (Hailee Steinfeld), and eventually, Peter ""Spider-Man"" Parker (Jake Johnson), taking them on another multiversal voyage that unites even more Spider-People, played well by the likes of Oscar Isaac, Issa Rae, Daniel Kaluuya (whose character hails from a sort of punk-rock universe, where everything is a magazine cut-out as you might see on a punk album, and is among the best in the movie), Karan Soni, and others. This is enthralling on its own, enough so that the 140-minute runtime feels like a jiff, but those who will get the most out of the film are the seasoned readers/viewers of Spidey media.I can't even begin to summarize all the callbacks and in-jokes in the film (nor should I; even a vague hint may be a spoiler). I can promise you that we can rest easy knowing that a certain character is -- rightly -- played by the same actor in every Spider-Man universe, animated or live-action. There's also The Spot (Jason Schwartzman), an underused Spidey villain whose powers lend themselves well to such a visually creative interdimensional roller-coaster as this. Rarely held in especially high regard by comic book fans (and the film knows it), he may be seen as one of the best villains after this film, particularly in terms of the role he plays in Miles' so-called ""canon event"", involving the possible fate of his father Officer Morales (Brian Tyree Henry), and the role canon events supposedly play in the lives of a true Spider-Man.It's worth noting that the movie makes better use of the multiverse concept, which you'll have noticed is all the rage lately, than most other modern examples, MCU or otherwise. Most notably, this is the sort of movie I feel that Spider-Man: No Way Home could've been but wasn't quite. Of course, the point of the Spider-Verse films is a different one:In the words of Brian Tallerico, Miles' is a story more about ""controlling your own fate than giving into a scripted narrative of heroism"" and ""holding onto the reality in your hands than imagine all of the other ones that might have been"" -- same with Gwen's, by extension. Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and David Callahan have penned one of those sequels that surpasses the original; let us hope that ""the third one is always the worst"" doesn't come true here. Nevertheless, I'll be happy to see these lovely characters again, and I, like seemingly many others, cannot wait to see what sort of worlds we're treated to next. I'll keep you here all day if I start gushing about the use of music.Across the Spider-Verse shines the same light as that of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Top Gun: Maverick, and others, reminding us not just of the fun of seeing movies in theaters again (instead of on streaming sites that drive away more and more consumers through insipid password-sharing rules, the removal/inhibition of ""unprofitable"" art, depriving India of cricket, etc.) but also of the fact that, yes, you can put heart, soul, effort, and creativity into superhero movies, still. (Superhero fatigue, as the success of this film proves, is certainly not the issue; co-writer Miller put it best: ""I believe it's a 'movie that feels like a movie I've seen a dozen times before' fatigue"".) By the time DC releases The Flash, not to mention whatever's in store for the post-WGA strikes landscape, I expect we'll have forgotten it again.",positive
828,"If you love the 1st part of spiderverse franchise then this film will be a treat to watch specially last 30 mins is a banger. What I like about most of this film is it's storyline the way writer has written it it's just phenomal. It's not an easy job to write a multiverse type of stories in which you had to put so much characters and you've to give space to each characters to justify their role in the film. This is my first time that I've seen so many Spiderman in just one frame and it's so satisfyitto watch that scene on a big screen.First half is all out about family reunion and character building stuff but don't give up your excitement because 2nd half of this film is on another level and the climax will blow you away. Gwen is the main hero of this film I would say. Because director has developed the character of gwen and put it in right beside Miles Morales. Animation is top notch it'll give you a comic relief if you are a comic nerd. Direction, Screenplay, Music all are top notch and speciality there are lot of emotional scenes that I didn't expect in this film.If you are a spiderman fan do not miss this gem. It's one of the best Spiderman film I've ever seen. Can't wait for the next part.",positive
829,"Spider-man across the spider-verse boasts an incredible story, graphics, animation styles, cameos and sound design. This movie is nearly perfect in every single way, except for one. The intro. I think that the intro is pretty great except for the fact that I feel it drags on to long. I think it really shines in the vulture attack, but I do feel as if the part where she explains Miles's situation is just a bit long, though I do feel that there some really great lines and visuals in that part. I also think that the part on the train where all of the spider-people are chasing Miles, is one of the best scenes in movie history. ""Nah. Ima do my own thing."" Literal chills. So in conclusion, one of the greatest Spider-man movies ever created, up there with The Dark Knight, and Avengers Infinity War as one of the best super hero movies ever brought to the big screen.",positive
830,"The best Spider-Man movie and the best movie based on comics. Well scripted and good edited. 100/10 in my opinion. I love the villain and the Graphics. I'm pretty sure that the next movie will be miles better than this one. I hope we will see beyonder spiderman or cosmic spiderman or even cosmic miles Morales because I love to see the link from comic books and the movies. Marvel needed this movie because, in my opinion the last movies released were not very amazing as the classics or maybe I am nostalgic but movies like Ironman or Captain America were masterpieces and this movie is a master piece too.",positive
831,"This movie, beyond the Sipderman script itfself, which is a really good job, will be a milestone in the history of animation, and movie. The junction of different styles, as the development of the characters are things that must be studied for future artists. I'm not joking that this movie may be as dramatic, fun, and complex as the very best productions of all the times. You should enjoy this in theaters, but you should re-watch it in home in HD, and check every detail of every frame. This won't let you down as a masterpiece as its finest form. Music, script, feelings, action, funny moments. This movie only lacks of your presence!!!",positive
832,"Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse is the greatest piece of animation ever hands down cannot be beat. The film picks up in Gwens universe hinting that this story is Miles's story told by Gwen. Every second of this movie is beautiful, vibrant, and colorful. It is a masterpiece of story telling and takes the multi-verse to a whole new level they represent the multi-verse perfectly. Every character plays a wonderful role in adding depth to the story. The story is perfect in every which way.it tells the story of a boy being betrayed because he is different and shouldnt exist. The plot twist at the end when miles gets sent to the wrong universe and he ends up being the prowler in that universe because there was no spider to bite him is just perfect and I am excited for part 2 next year.",positive
833,"Genuinely such a well crafted movie and a visual masterpiece to experience. It's one of the movies you'd wish you could watch for the first time again. Incredibly well written dialogue with so much thought put into it, yet it doesn't feel unnatural.Although I find the characters to be the highlight of it. It is quite rare to find a movie like this where everything is thought out and such an amazing attention to the details and that's not even mentioning the easter eggs scattered throughout the film, but I can't forget the phenomenal and unique soundtrack. In general, I'd say this is a movie that's a 10/10 in every aspect.",positive
834,"What a ride this was. I actually like the first movie but this was something else. The main character are unlikeable and annoying. Gwen tries to get away with MURDER and blames her dad for all her problems. The movie presents this as a good thing for some reason. Miles spends the whole movie blaming everyone but himself for his problems and at the end tries to save his dad at the expanse of his entire universe. As a result it was extremely hard for me to sympathize with him.Because the leads were outright obnoxious the film was frustrating to watch.There are more spider - people in the movie, but they are relegated to supporting roles, feal one note and lack depth. A good example of this is Ben Reilly, he is used as a through away joke and not given any complexity. I'm not saying every spiderman in the movie needs to be a complex character, but more than 3 deep characters would have been nice.One thing the film could have done to remedy this problem is to present the two sides of the main conflict equally, letting the audience pick a side. Instead, the movie chooses to depict spiderman 2099 as an all out villain.The concept of Canon events is full of plot holes, like how there were no disruptions to the canon in the first movie, and how is Miguel living in a different universe even a disruption of a canon event ecs...
Because of this, the main conflict fells meaningless and hollow as a result of a lack of consistency in the main driving force for it.The movie is also a ""two parter"" for no reason. The movie is leading to one obvious end point but decides to draw out the plot into two separate movies. I've seen a lot of people use this as an excuse as to why the movie's structure isn't good, but that is an extremely lazy claim. Avengers endgame was always meant to be a part one of two avengers films but it had an infinitely better structure than ATSV.Not all is bad though. One thing that is consistently great is the animation. The different styles are stunning and the action is a true spectacle.Also Spot was a great villain that was extremely underutilized in the movie, I hope they use him a lot more in the sequel.Overall, this movie was a giant let down. I hope the next one is good.",positive

836,"This was my first DBox theater experience in general, and my first theater experience this year (2023), and this movie was the PERFECT film to go see.The first Spider-Verse movie is one of my all time favorites, so I knew I HAD to go see this movie when it released. It was a requirement. I genuinely thought it'd be next to impossible for them to top the first movie, but they somehow managed to do it, and completely knocked it out of the park. It takes you through a DEEP and emotional plot, while also keeping you excited and interested with its natural and fun dialogue, BEAUTIFULLY crafted animation, extremely mood setting soundtrack, and its LARGE cast of characters.This film was amazing from start to finish, and I love EVERYTHING about it. Down to the last detail.",positive

838,"Its storytelling is massive and dominating, challenging you to keep pace with the multi faceted structure, often juxtaposed simultaneously. It's hilariously fun and barbarically creative.However, the saying goes: Too much of a good thing.The style distracts, the storytelling yields to jarring tonal shifts, the structure's brutalised by endless humour and the creativity doesn't know when it's kinda pushed the boundaries into the silly-verse.It's hard not to see a cleaner, more tightly edited movie in here amongst the scatter brain vignettes.But despite it all, this admirably isn't anything close to a mess. This is actually a well realised, highly entertaining, often powerful sequel. Building endlessly through exposition and narrative twists that rarely feel forced.But mostly, it's thanks to the always important understanding that characters are a movie's number one asset.Some are given more to do this time around, some are sidelined (no doubt made up for in next years threequal), but the shining stars get development hitting right in the emotional sweet spot and sprinkled so tastefully throughout the madness. Keeping a film flying so high on its own creative freedom, planted firmly on the ground.",positive
839,"5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse is an awesome animated superhero film that tops the previous film as it continues the Miles Morales storyline and this time taking its setting in other multiverse which him and several other spider mans are trying to stop a villain called the Spot. The action sequences are incredible. Its very stylistic while the animation is an energetic filled that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Editors and directors were amped up on energy drinks working on this project. The soundtrack and music score is awesome. The story is great. It dives into an emotional connection with Miles responsibility as Spider Man vs. Telling his mom and dad about his secret. While trying to save everyone. The film ends in a bang and a cliffhanger which you ll be anxious for a sequel.Overall, it is one fun wild ride that is a superhero film that is energetic and stylish that wont disappoint to superhero or action fans.",positive

841,"I am in awe of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement. It is beyond extraordinary, a staggering work of art!This might be the greatest comic book film of all time, and if not it is certainly in the conversation because it isn't just a great comic book movie - it's a great movie. It sits alongside some I have ever experienced - and I say experienced because of the greatest sequels ever made - The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part I, and The Dark Knight as one of those all-time great sequels that manage to live up to, if not surpass their respective original films. You may think I am exaggerating, but trust me when I say this is an insane, creative, and groundbreaking feat of cinema, I mean it!What more can I say to convince you to see it? Like I just gave a movie some of the highest praise I can give, but might as well continue at this point. To me, the film was flawless right from the beginning! This is one of the best films I have ever experienced - and I say experienced because this was such a wild ride. I genuinely did not expect half of what happened in the movie, it managed to really surprise and delight me the entire time! I didn't even expect it to be this good, never mind that it would actually manage to surpass the incredible original film! Across the Spider-Verse does not attempt to replicate the success of its predecessor. It aims to elevate, expand, and reinvent this franchise and the medium of animation in general.Why did it work so well? Not because of the multiple Spider-Man cameos and easter eggs (those were fun), but instead because it tells a dark, more mature story that, even in part one form, is pretty heartfelt and moving. There are some really wonderful emotional beats. The story is 100% rooted in character and relationships, with emotional depth and real conflicting ideologies that you believe. The first half of Across the Spider-Verse genuinely had some of the most authentic and human scenes ever presented in a comic book film. Shots linger on characters as it focuses on their struggles and drama. It's filled with a blend of sincerity and epic spectacle that redefines what superhero storytelling can - and should - be. The multiverse story is quite complex - but thankfully the story is told by truly gifted storytellers so the film really makes it seem so simple, leading you through it all with one foot in front of the other.And the animation... OH MY GOD! There is no other way this story could have been told. This film excels because it uses animation to its highest strength; it could have only been told in this medium. Across the Spider-Verse is truly a testament to what movies can achieve with animation. Animation is the perfect medium for these stories, it allows for completely unbounded imagination and really creative artistic designs that make the concept of a multiverse a lot more compelling and interesting than we have ever seen before. Not to mention, the animation is gorgeous. It is so richly detailed, blending many different styles in one frame. I loved how each universe and character not only looked completely different but were animated and coloured in extremely different styles. There are so many shots that blew my mind; I would love to break this movie down frame by frame. Every frame truly was a painting. This is one of the greatest achievements of American animation, an incredibly groundbreaking film the likes of which I've never seen before. It truly is a work of art and artistic genius, really pushing the boundaries of what can be done with animation. There is truly more to be said about the visuals of this film than we'll probably ever be able to say. The animation is astounding, but it's even more fascinating to consider how it's deeply layered into the emotional core of the film. The hues and design often change - within the same scene - as the emotion swings. And the results are breathtaking.Imagine the transcendent experience after seeing Snow White back in 1937, the cinematically emotional aftermath of The Empire Strikes Back, and the love people have for Spider-Man in every sense of the word: That's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I love this movie! I went in with very high expectations and it still exceeded those! I felt the same way after Across the Spider-Verse that I did after The Last Jedi! So many interesting thematic questions were posed and many surprising twists have left me unable to predict how this will be resolved in Beyond the Spider-Verse next year!Words can't explain how big of an accomplishment this movie is for animation, cinema, and just media adaptations as a whole. This is truly the best of the best. If you're even remotely a fan of this genre you'll remember where you were when you experienced this - I know I always will. There's so much soul, creativity, and pure love for Spidey. I was smiling ear to ear for so much of it simply because it understands this character so much. Such a beautiful movie visually and thematically, it absolutely fills my heart with joy.The cool thing about it is that the visual energy and imagination are cranked so high and the whole thing is so thrilling that I would sometimes forget to blink and/or breathe. It flies by, is perfectly paced, and is riveting from beginning to end. The action is fantastic, the visuals are beautiful, and the musical score by Daniel Pemberton is absolutely insane. I love how gorgeous, complex, creative, ambitious, and full of heart it is. I'm just purely floored, this was a masterpiece. It blows the original out of the water for me, it's one of those special films that showcases how powerful animation, as well as good storytelling, can be. It was perfect - one of the most energetic and artfully animated films I've ever seen!It's a scary time for the film industry, where it seems like studios have turned originality and ambition into the enemy. It's such a joy to see films like Spider-Verse released that represent the art form at its most imaginative and, as a result, impactful. AI could not have made Across the Spider-Verse. There's humanity in every frame, line, musical note, and emotional beat. So thank you to all the artists who contributed to this phenomenal film, it could never have been half as good without all of your hard work, creativity, ambition, and dedication! I'm truly at a loss for words at how good this turned out, and will be seeing it many, many times over again!",positive
842,"The first spiderverse was genius. This is a mess. Too long, too complex and almost zero humor. I felt lost from the outset, like I hadn't seen the first one. And it ended with a to be continued!!! After two hours and twenty minutes. Wtf? The graphics were unserious, and too unfinished, like they got lazy and just washed all the colors and backgrounds. The first movie was clever and told a story that was understandable. This one tried to be too clever and added layers that werent needed, like the dad's promotion party or drawn out conversations that led nowhere. Sorry I didn't get this one at all or what was so special about it.",neutral
843,"The current animated Spidey adventure in theaters. Following up on the events from the last feature, Miles Morales, has somewhat settled into his role as the friendly neighborhood webslinger but the eternal schism between doing his duty as a crime fighter & being an upstanding son/student starts to weigh on him especially illustrated as he fights off his self proclaimed nemesis The Spot, voiced by Jason Schwartzman (who'll feature more prominently into the story as it goes along), as he navigates a meeting w/his parents & guidance counselor. A visit from his old friend Gwen Stacey soon thrusts him into a multi-verse (he tagged along w/o her knowing) he knew nothing about (populated by multiple Spider people) which opens his eyes to not only to the universes at large but his essential part in it. Blending hip hop aesthetics to the visuals (which change sometimes from scene to scene much less world to world), we get a visual smorgasbord of references of animated & even in some circumstances live action, Spider people, animals & even his villains in a story which runs the gamut of emotions & incident leaving the viewer punch drunk which in this case is a good thing. The follow-up is slated for next year but w/the writer's strike underway who knows if that berth will hold.",positive
844,"Daniel Pemberton the one and the only.. One of the important reasons to made the previous masterpiece ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" in top 250 movies and he is doing it again with this piece of art ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" after 5 years!I'm sure he will make the next part of the series ""Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse"".I wonder why he didn't won the Oscar yet! And nominated for one Oscar only ! Can you believe that ?!!He is one of the best musicians on the field now , I hope he read this.Can't wait until his next work it will be a great addition to any movie he work on.",positive
845,"The highly anticipated sequel to the Oscar-winning movie doesn't let the audience down when it comes to its animation. Spider-Punk stands out among the new characters introduced and feels like he has much more to offer in the upcoming sequel, along with the villain of the movie Spot. Oscar Isaac's Miguel O'hara is a complete menace and almost feels like a different character from his introduction in the first part, which played out for the sack of memes. The soundtrack is so well curated that it might even surpass the original one. Shout out to Metro Boomin, and look out for his cameo. Does this follow-up surpass the original one? I will say no; the origin of Miles still remains one of the best introductions to any character in a movie. But it's a complete fanfest filled with Easter eggs, which only New Rockstars can breakdown for you. The return of Nic Cage's Spider Noir band with the likes of Pavitra Pravakar and Hobi Brown excites me for the final arc of the story. With the level of Easter eggs Sony was able to pull up for this movie, a man can only dream about the possibilities the next part has to offer.",positive
846,"Review:

847,"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Everything about this is stunning. I basically only have one complain which I will get back to, and that one reason is the only reason I am not giving this a 10/10. The rest however... oh man oh man...This is one of those movies that come along once every decade and will be remembered forever and will be on everyone's top 20 lists together with the Godfather, Jaws and Star Wars. That is how good this is. I have so much praise I do not know were to start, but let me mention the very best of the best. The voice acting is so amazing, you feel every scene, every line, and it match up perfectly. Spider Gween is my new favourite character, she is so fantastic here, and this coming year we will see girls dressed as her everywhere. The story is compelling, fun but also mature and actually almost dark. This is mainly made for teens, but as an adult I really appreciate the more adult themes. But what I remember most is the overall experience. I cannot tell you the myriad of feelings I felt in the theatre, and leaving afterwards I wanted more. I was very close to buy another ticket, but sadly I had work to go to.This is something very special. The experience of this movie I can personally best compare to seeing the very first Jurassic Park movie back in 1993. You are dazed, mesmerised, and feel euphoric and happy.The only bad thing I can think of with this movie is that it is not really made for me. And I mean that mainly from a visual point of view. Don't get me wrong, the visuals and the animation is a pure masterpiece by itself, but for my poor middle-age brain I almost felt like getting a seizure sometimes. This is definitely made for the newer generations seeing things in every corner, blinking lights everywhere, screens in every hand and both behind and in front of you. A few times this is like watching a show someone fired a bazooka with colours at the screen while some kids playing around with said colours and then you have an elephant rush through the entire palett. It is too much at times.That is the only complaint I have. That this is a bit messy for my brain to process a few times in the movie. I deduct one point for that because it reduces my own personal experience.I do not think I can fault anything else. This is a masterpiece, and a must see for everyone. And I predict now that this movie will be this generation of teens biggest hit. If this movie does not have the longest legs and earn billions then the world is coming to an end.Stunning movie, brilliant masterpiece, and a must see. 9/10 and I cannot recommend this enough.",positive
848,"This movie is hands down the best Spiderman movie! The shear breadth of animation styles is stunning. Not just animation styles but art styles, paint styles. We got to see old pals and many new spiders! I can't wait to get this on digital so I can pause and really take in all the chaos. The characters are very well fleshed out and SpiderGwens story is really touching. I appreciate the writers not trying to force a romantic relationship between Miles and Wendy. If it happens, it happens. If not, that's cool too. I'm definitely going to see this again and hope that screaming kid 3 rows behind me isn't there.",positive

Surely it doesn't look like anything!Then at the end, how did the mum not realise it wasn't her Myles??Anyway, I think they tried a bit too hard with the diversity of the spiderpeople.

Shameik moore really gets into the character and also Hailee stainfield i can't talk more about her, she really perfect for this character. And now the king is the story, the story was really really bigger, better than the first movie, and all things was unexpected, and i thingk this is the best superhero movie of all time. If you searching a movie to watch this weekend, i will recomended this movie, the cinematography is also good all of the frame was like a wallpaper. And i can't wait to see more on Spider-man beyond the spider verse.",positive
851,"Genius animation with a fresh plot. If you were expecting the same ol' tired cliches, then I suggest you merely watch a rerun.This movie strikes the usual nerve with those who feel inclusion is offensive, but this is the real world and we all share it.Gwen's side of the story catches the essence of being a unique (possibly trans) woman in a world that rejects those who are different. Her struggles are real, yet she still decides to be a hero in a world that rejects her.Miles' side of the story has him fighting a future that already seems set in stone, with those around him simply expecting him to just let it be that way. Giving miles a tough choice of listening to others or doing what he can to change a possibly inevitable, heartbreaking outcome.This movie leaves us with quite the cliff hanger, I hope they don't delay in releasing the next chapter, asap.Another masterpiece animation from a gifted team of animators, visual artists, voice actors and writers. I hope they keep up the good work.",positive
852,"My kid and I were almost angry when this movie ended...not because it sucked or disappointed, but because waiting another 9 months to see the rest of this story felt almost cruel. The first Spider-verse movie redefined what we can expect from an animated movie, and the latest chapter somehow took it another level. The art? Unlike anything I have seen before. The story? Almost like a deconstruction of comic book stories. I was completely enamored from the first scene, and the 140 minute runtime practically flew by. If I could have stayed in my seat and watched it again, I would have considered it. MCU movies (and superhero movies in general) have gotten pretty tired for me, but this? This is reason to believe that IP/franchise storytelling can truly be great.",neutral
853,"I have been a Spider-Man fan pretty much my entire life, and I never felt like an adaption of the character met its full potential: I loved the Rami films, but even those are imperfect, the 'Amazing' series has a great lead in Garfield, but ultimately feel soulless and the MCU ones feel a little too bogged down into fitting into that series' cannon and feels even more soulless than the 'Amazing' films. So, I thought, that this character's future would lay solely in mediocrity with MCU, until Sony Pictures Animation, who, bar a few examples, are masters in mediocrity, released 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' in 2018, and changed everything: this film was not only a landmark for comic book filmmaking, but also the entire medium of animation as a whole. I feel in love this film the moment I saw it, I was aware of the Spider-Verse storyline from the comics, but this film elevates it and its lead, Miles Morales, into legacy status. This film wasn't only a perfect Spider-Man film, but a perfect film period. This acclaim lead to two sequels announced, the first of which, 'Across the Spider-Verse' has finally released.I was anxious about this film, as the first film is one of my favourites of all time and I had made my prince that, as along as it is just 'good', it didn't have to as good as the first, but, fortunately, the team behind this film shocked me as once again, and delivered something as good as it's predecessor, but also, exists as its own masterpiece as well.A year and a half after Miles saved the multiverse, he is still struggling balancing his two lives and finding piece in his Spider-Man identity, while, Gwen Stacey returns and takes Miles to a mysterious group of other Spider-People, ran by the brooding, Miguel O'Hara, aka, Spider-Man 2099.One of the most groundbreaking things about the first film was its breathtaking animation, which pushed the medium to its bounds and crafted a style entirely of its own, and while I thought this film would look great, I did not think it would advance itself, yet again form its predecessor. Yet, this film's animation outdoes the first, each dimension, and in most cases, Spider-Person, has their unique look, which somehow, blends together perfectly.The characters from the first film are just as perfect here, and the new ones fit in perfectly, Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Punk and Spider-Man India stood out in particular. Every main character is written with intricacy and never feel like an archetype, each character is loaded with depth and a compelling personality.One of the things that made 'Into the Spider-Verse' so special when compared to other comic book film was its story, instead of a clich√©d, bland action movie story, we got a plot that gave us those superhero clich√©s, but also gave us deeper themes going on underneath the story. 'Across' accomplishes this too, but, as well as exploring deeper (and some more meta-textual) themes than the first, the main story is darker as well, more complex morals, and a generally more mature atmosphere bleed into the film.This film's soundtrack and score are also an improvement over the first, the score in particular, every Spider-Person is given their own unique theme which are all excellent.The direction excels here too, just as much as the first, with snappy action and breathtaking quieter moments too. The editing is as perfect as the first, but even more impressive, as the film's larger scope and more chaotic plot, makes a harder editing challenge, but, everything flows together perfectly and never feels overwhelming.So, overall, 'Across the Spider-Verse', is somehow, another masterpiece from this incredible team, and even though it is only part one of a two part story, with 'Beyond the Spider-Verse' next year, is another filmmaking masterpiece, which I am sure will leave just as much of an impact as the first, it easily matches its quality and maybe excels it. It defines Miles Morales as Spider-Man, and cements that he is the best one put to screen.Here's hoping for a Best Picture nomination.",positive
854,"I loved the movie i cant really say if its better than the first movie; only time will tell. If this is where animation is headed for then im all in. The only downside i can really say is that the ending just wants you craving for more, i honestly could have watched 2 or more hours of straight this. The bridge for the end was laid out so perfectly but its sad that they had to make this into a trilogy, I guess we will have to wait for some years so the writers can cook up some intresting plot and convey the message they wanted to say.In the end its a masterpiece, they stepped up thier game for this, 5 year wait was really worth it.",positive
855,"This is my second review on my account that I've had over 5 years, and this movie warrants it. Out of every other animated movie I've seen, this now sets the bar.The animation is astonishingly amazing. Best of any animated film OR show I've ever seen. Each second of the movie is filled with amazing visuals, even warranting some audible 'wow's out of me while watching. The storyline is very good and is excellently paced. Character development is on point and some compelling characters were introduced. Lots of welcome surprises with the plot and characters as well. The music is just right, and not overdone like the last one - and really add to the movie. The fluffy scenes were there, and - depending on preference - may be overdone or sufficient. Most people complain of the cliffhanger, but I prefer it this way - as it allows the movie to include all relevant information and have the perfect pace, instead of being rushed.Overall an incredible pleasure to watch. Easily and a solid 10, no doubt about it. I'll be sure to watch Beyond the Spiderverse as soon as its released.",positive
856,"Across the Spider-Verse is amazing for like, a billion different reasons.I rewatched both the first movie and this one back to back to try and catch new things, and I realized they improved and moved forward with this movie in the best possible ways. The animation is just perfect, every world feels unique and has its own identity, and every person in the screen shows so much emotion and character just through all the subtle details in the animation. They really took it forward with this movie, I don't know how. The pacing, character building, tension, small moments, it's all such a please to watch.But the character they've built around Miles has always made me connect with the movie more than almost anything I've ever watched. That's why these movies are so special to me, and they really nailed it again. Some people feel that there wasn't a lot that happened in this movie, and while that can be debated, I think it does so much more than just progress a plot forward. They captured what makes Miles so special to so many people around the world. I've been fake web-slinging since I was 3, watching anything and everything Spider-Man, and at 18, I can say that I don't know if any character has done it like this before.Miles and his world feel so real. Even while juggling this complex multiversal plot, they stick to him and his family. It feels like something I and a lot of other people are going through. While the first movie was about figuring out who he is, this one explores defending that identity as you move through new experiences and as you want to ""spread your wings"" and fly. And it's hard and a little weird. And the dynamic between his parents and him are perfect, the concern, the mixed emotions, but the ultimate love that drives every action of this family. While everyone else seems to have their own idea of what should happen, who Miles should be, Miles fights for himself, his family, and for who he is and what in his mind, Spider-Man stands for.",positive
857,"I enjoyed part one but part two was very difficult to watch,
The action was too fast to even make sense so you would have to rewind and watch again.They tried to cram so much into every scene it was impossible to follow and understand,
Then ,to make it look actiony they added so much flashing and very brite scenes which actually gave me a headache!I had to stop and take an excedrin for a mild migraine.Its like in Japan when they showed a movie and the children had to be treated for convulsions,
If the sequences were slowed down a little and the plot left to take a more natural progression it would have been a good movie,
FASTER isn't better and speed really not necessary. What was the hurry anyway?Let us savor and enjoy the movie much like a fine wine.Slow part three down and I might just watch it,
If its like part two I will watch no more,",positive

Without revealing any spoilers, I can confidently say that this movie is a visual and narrative triumph that will leave viewers mesmerized and craving for more.

But it's not just the visuals that make it outstanding. The story is engaging and well-crafted, keeping you glued to the screen from start to finish. The characters are well-developed and captivating, each with their own unique backstory and personality. The soundtrack is an energetic mix of songs that perfectly fit the film's atmosphere. One of the strengths of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is its humor. The well-timed jokes and comedic moments are cleverly sprinkled throughout the entire movie, providing genuine laughs without ever compromising the tension or emotion of the more intense moments. Furthermore, the film tackles deep and universal themes such as identity, courage, and responsibility, adding another layer of depth to the characters and making them even more relatable and compelling. I cannot fail to mention the voice cast, which is simply outstanding. Each actor delivers a impactful performance and fits their character perfectly. The voices convey authentic emotions, bringing the characters to life and giving them depth and complexity.

859,"Honestly I don't even have words to describe how amazing and beautiful this movie was. From art style, to direction, to story everything was just on point.Usually the sequel are kinda let down as compared to their original ones, but this one sets the bar way too high.I just love how the action scenes rolled out in a fast motion way unlike the other spiderman films where they just drag things way too much.They way this film touched and expressed the gravity and dynamics of Peter Parker relationship with his family. None of the other six films ( live action one) have done it. You really started to feel the emotions involved in that equation. Way too good.",positive
860,"The first movie in this new franchise featuring the new version animated web-slinging Marvel Comics hero, and other versions of him together, was an Oscar winning success, which I appreciated much more on the second viewing, so I had my hopes high for this sequel. Basically, on Earth-65, Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) in her regular life is a drummer in a rock band and live with her police captain father, George (Shea Whigham). But she lives a double life, fighting crime as Spider-Woman, although she is being hunted by the police. A few years ago, her best friend Peter Parker (Jack Quaid) was revealed to be the Lizard, and whilst fighting, a building collapsed. Gwen tried to save him, but it was too late, and Captain Stacy assumed he was murdered by Spider-Woman. One night, Gwen encounters a version of the Vulture (Jorma Taccone) from an Italian Renaissance-themed alternate universe. He is defeated with the help of ninja-vampire Miguel O'Hara aka Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and pregnant black Jessica Drew aka Spider-Woman (Issa Rae) who arrive using portal-generating watches. Gwen is found and cornered by George, who tries to take her in, forcing her to reveal her true identity. He is shocked to see his own daughter but does not listen to her try to explain and continues to place her under arrest. She escapes through a portal with Miguel and Jess and is granted membership in the Spider-Society. In Brooklyn on Earth-1610, sixteen months after the destruction of the Kingpin's collider, Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is adapting to fighting crime as Spider-Man. He is missing Gwen from their previous encounter and struggling to live up to the expectations of his parents, Jeff (Brian Tyree Henry) and Rio (Luna Lauren Velez). He encounters Dr. Jonathan Ohnn aka the Spot (Jason Schwartzman), an Alchemax scientist whose body was infused with portals after the collider explosion, and he blames Miles for his situation. It is revealed that the spider that bit Miles was transported by the collider whilst the Spot was testing it before its destruction; the spider came from Earth-42. The Spot learned to travel to other universes containing the Alchemax collider and used them to become more powerful. Gwen travels to Earth-1610 after tracking the Spot across dimensions and reconnects with Miles. Using his power of invisibility, Miles watches as Gwen traces the Spot to his next location before Jess calls telling her to leave. Miles follows Gwen after she opens a portal to Mumbattan, a massive metropolis in India on Earth-50101. They team up with Spider-Men Pavitr Prabhakar (Karan Soni) and Hobie Brown (Daniel Kaluuya) against the Spot, who successfully absorbs the power of Earth-50101's collider. Before the Spot escapes, he and Miles share a vision of Miles's father dying at the Spot's hands. As the collider collapses, Miles saves Pavitr's girlfriend's father, a police captain, but this is revealed to be ""canon event"", and the disruption causes Mumbattan to fall apart. Members of the Spider-Society arrive to assess the damage of the dimensional anomaly, while Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are sent to the Society's headquarters at Nueva York on Earth-928. There, hundreds of Spider-People from numerous universes reside in a massive complex, and Miles is reunited with Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) with his infant daughter Mayday. Miguel explains that canon events are essential to every Spider-Person in the ""Spider-Verse"", such as the death of loved ones, and that reality could be threatened if they are strayed. Miguel admits that he tried to replace himself in another universe where he was dead and he had a family, but in doing so he caused that universe to collapse. Jeff is being promoted to police captain in two days, and Miles realises that the Spot murdering him is a canon event. Miguel imprisons Miles so he will not try to save his father, but Hobie helps Miles to escape before using a portal to quit the Society. All Spider-People are ordered by Miguel to apprehend Miles, resulting in a frenzied chase through the complex and city. Miguel eventually corners Miles and tells him that he was never supposed to become Spider-Man, and that Earth-42 consequently has no Spider-Man. Miles flees and, with the help of Margo Kess aka Spider-Byte (Amandla Stenberg), returns to what he believes is his home dimension. Gwen is considered by Miguel a liability, she and is ejected from the Society and sent home. Gwen reconciles with George, who has decided to resign as police captain. He gives her a watch Hobie had left for her, and Gwen decides to use it to aid Miles. Miles returns to his apartment and reveals to his mother that he is Spider-Man, but she does not recognise him. After glitching, Miles realises that he is on Earth-42, the world the spider came from, where his deceased uncle Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali) is alive while Jeff is dead. Miguel, Jess, and Ben Reilly aka Scarlet Spider (Andy Samberg) travel to Earth-1610 searching for Miles. Gwen arrives through her own portal, speaking to Miles's parents she promises to bring him home, while Jess spies on their conversation. Aaron interrogates Miles alongside Earth-42's Miles G. Morales (Jharrel Jerome), who has become the Prowler. As the Spot returns to Earth-1610 and begins his attack, Gwen assembles a team to find Miles, consisting of Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, Margo, Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and Spider-Ham (John Mulaney). Also starring Greta Lee as LYLA, Taran Killam as Patrick O'Hara aka Web-Slinger, Nic Novicki as Lego Spider-Man, Josh Keaton as Peter Parker aka Spectacular Spider-Man, Yuri Lowenthal as Peter Parker aka Insomniac Spider-Man, Mike Rianda as Ezekiel Sims aka Spider-Therapist, Sofia Barclay as Malala Windsor aka Spider-UK, Danielle Perez as Charlotte Webber aka Sun-Spider, Metro Boomin as Metro-Spider, Max Borne aka Spider-Man 2211, Melissa Sturm as Mary Jane ""MJ"" Parker, Peter Sohn as Ganke Lee, Rachel Dratch as Ms. Weber, Ziggy Marley as Lenny, Atsuko Okatsuka as Yuri Watanabe, J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Perkins as Aunt May, Kathryn Hahn as Olivia ""Liv"" Octavius aka Doctor Octopus, Post Malone as Brooklyn bystander, Donald Glover (in live action) as Aaron Davis aka Prowler, and Peggy Lu (in live action) as Mrs. Chen. The voice cast are all great again, Moore and Steinfeld standing out most as the leading heroes, and all alternative versions of Spider-Man bring something to the party. The first movie I admit confused and overwhelmed me a bit and I had to watch it again, but I settled more with this sequel. The colourful animation with occasional comic book texts and various changes in style to differentiate the various universes characters are from is clever and imaginative, and the chases and fight sequences are again big scale and energetic, it is another feast for the eyes, something for all the family, and I look forward to the continuation, an impressive computer-animated superhero action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Animated Feature Film, and Original Score for Daniel Pemberton, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score, Best Motion Picture - Animated, and
Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. Very good!",positive
861,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson is mind-blowing, engaging and suspenseful. Following the 2018 release, Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse, this film surpassed all expectations and I believe is the absolute finest Spider-Man film that follows the plot of Miles Morales.The storyline follows 17-year-old Miles Morales, who was bitten by a radio-active spider, gained spider-like abilities, and became the one and only Spider-Man in Brooklyn, NY after the death of Peter Parker. Miles is working hard to balance school and social life, while trying to live up to his parent's expectations, all while saving the world. During this time, an old friend, Gwen Stacey (Hailee Steinfeld) comes to visit Miles. As she leaves, Miles follows her and is catapulted across the universe, jumping from universe to universe on an extreme adventure where he needs to refine what it means to be a hero so he can save those he loves most.This film managed to keep me hooked throughout the entire two plus hour run time. It equally balances elements of comedy and drama, while portraying the characters experiencing some real life situations. My favorite character is Miles' long-time, devoted friend, Gwen Stacy, a.k.a Ghost-Spider. Gwen comes from an extremely rough home situation. Considering her father, soon-to-be police captain, has a personal hatred for Ghost-Spider, she spent most nights debating her worth as a person -- if her own father does not see the good she does as Ghost-Spider, what is her purpose? However, this allows her to quickly bond with Miles, whose father also works in the police field. In this film, Gwen experiences obvious character development and proves her loyalty to Miles. Even though she associates herself with the ""spider-verse"" secret society, which eventually works against Miles, she tries endlessly to keep Miles away, since she knows the danger. She never encourages him to join, nor does she even inform him of it. Once it is made clear the spider-verse secret society is in no way going to help or agree with Miles, she makes it clear whose side she is on. Eventually she gathers alongside a few other Spider-Men and forms her own group, specifically devoted to saving Miles. Though it hasn't been confirmed, Gwen and Miles do have a relationship developing -- the chemistry between them made me want to see Gwen save him even more.The film's message is to always make the right choice, even if it does not benefit your own wants or needs. You must always rise above and make the choice between selfishness and selflessness.I give Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. This film releases in theaters June 2, 2023. Check it out! By Nathalia J., KIDS FIRST!",positive
862,"To start off with, I like to write unbiased and fair reviews of films so that people know if it's good or not.With that out of the way, this film is excellent in every way: the perfect balance of atmosphere and action, animation styles, making this film much better than any other film I have seen beforehand.The score is beautifully written and the characters are well developed and heartfelt. When the film finished, all I felt was the incredible feeling this film created; simply stunning.It combines cultures, unique ideas and unexpected plot twists in such a way that no other film I have ever seen can.So, if you are thinking about watching this masterpiece, hesitate no longer.",positive
863,"I don't care what anyone says; ending a film at what is effectively the end of a second act is not good story telling. I could tolerate it if the 3rd film were to come out next weekend (which I actually think could be a great marketing strategy for these block buster hits), but that is not the case.The one negative out of the way, the rest of the film really is insanely good. I can confidently say that this was the fastest a film has gone by for me minute for minute. I could not believe 2 hours and twenty minutes had passed by. This film does not dip into my top 20 of all time but it was still one hell of an experience.",positive
864,"I was so pleasantly surprised when I watched the first one; it immediately set a very high bar. From all the hype, I was expecting to be blown away by the sequel, but honestly I wasn't. It was still quite good of course, but I do like the first one better. That being said, this was also the second of a double feature at a drive in, so I may have just been a bit tired at that point.Great voice acting and great visuals. Some deep emotional scenes. Should win best animated film.The multiverse is the current trend with comic book films, but the first was sort of the pioneer in that department. In the sequel, we see the Spider-Society where the multiverse is commonplace, yet in the first one it was all very new to those characters, but more importantly, there was zero intervention from the society which is weird, no? In any case, still a good and entertaining story.",positive
865,Movie was so long i started rooting for the bad guys just so it would end sooner. Every time i thought it would end something else happened to make it even longer. I was not even on a time crunch i was just bored of it at that point. Way too many plot points and twists and turns and it made it just plain boring and lame. I was sitting in that theater for hours just playing flappy dunk & praying it would end so i could go home and go to sleep. Not worth it either it was not even good. Do not waste your time watching this lame movie. I am warning you it will drain you and take up your whole day.,negative
866,"It is a particularly funny movie. I'll be honest, the first time movie 1 scenes on tv didn't catch my attention at all. Then a relative told me that it was good so I saw it. Since then I had been waiting to see it. I liked everything, the plot, the sound and especially the animation.I'm a fan of animation and I'm talking about good animation: the details, the movements, the way they make them look like human movements; and this movie is very good in that sense. Now the detail is that I want more. I literally can't wait to see a sequel (if there is one).I had time without having this feeling. I recommend this movie 100%.",positive
867,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is hands down one of the best animated films ever. It brings us a story that we're so invested in as a audience that by the time the end credits roll, we don't want it to end. The animation, the story, the characters, and the voice acting alone make this film as special as it is. Shameik Moore returns once more as Miles Morales and he gives his best performance as the character that we have seen yet. Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy shines brighter than ever and I was finally glad to get a backstory for her character. Oscar Issac proves he can play any character in any Marvel franchise or universe for say as Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 proving why he is still one of the best actors currently working in Hollywood today. It was also good to see Jake Johnson's Peter B. Parker return with his new baby, although his screen time gets severely cut in this film compared to the last film. Jason Schwartman as the villain Spot I'm not gonna lie I thought was just going to be a typical villain, but I was dead wrong. He brings his A game for this film and gives us a villain that is not only comical at times, but very menacing and disturbing that leaves a chill down your spine and keeps you so invested on what he might do next. Daniel Kaluuya's Spider-Punk and Karan Spin's Spider-Man India were some of my favorite of the new Spider-Man's to come to this film. I also loved the voice performances from Brian Tyree Henry and Lauren V√©lez as Jefferson Davis and Rio Morales. The other cameo's we got were great as well. Most people have said they didn't expect it to hang off on a cliffhanger like it did and that was one of the films takeaways, but honestly I was more than satisfied with the end result by how speechless I was after viewing the film. Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is probably not only one of the best animated movies ever, but also one of the best comic book movies ever as well and I can't wait for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. Rating: 9.5/10.",positive
868,"I do not think this is a great animated movie. I do not think this is a great spiderman movie. I think this is a great movie, period. Actually, I take that back. I dont think this is just a great movie. I think this may be in the top 3 greatest movies I have ever watched. Its better than any MCU film, its miles better than any of the classic golden age Disney Renassiance films of 89-99(yes im sorry, even the Lion King), its better than any film that has won best picture in the last 15-20 years. The Oscars must not be stupid and overlook this epic masterpiece. Do yourself a favor, watch the first if you havent, and then take the family to watch this one. I wish I could buy it right now but im deff going back to see it. Lord and Miller really outdid themselves for this film.",positive
869,"The first movie was a real revolution among animated films, mainly for the animaion ut also for the story, being complex, interesting and sometimes dark but still managing to be funny and for everyone, so I was also looking forward to this one but not thinking it could make another revolution on its own; now Im convinced it IS another revolution among animated films, the animation in this movie can only e summarized in the words amazing and spectacular, every frame of the movie could perfectly be a poster and a very good one, the way everything is animated is perfect, just perfect. They didnt only used all the naimation styles and techniques there are, but they went as far as inventing new ones just for this movie, you levae the theather with no words after the movie. With that said, the animation is obviously its strongest point but the story is another hit, it is almost just as good as the first one, buuuut, the one thing I find more weird than anything is the ending, I understand that it is divided in 2 parts and everything but it just made me feel empty, and not empty like when youre doing something you really like and then its over, more like just incomplete, I guess watching the 2nd part it will make more sense and be better and my 9 could potentially transform into a 10 but for now, only and for that feeling of incompliteness alone I give this a 9, but everything else in this movie is a 10.",positive
870,"""Across the Spider-Verse"" is quite simply one of the best comic book films in years as well as a near perfect sequel. It builds upon the already fantastic ""Into the Spider-Verse"" to create a truly captivating, thrilling, and unforgettable experience.The first film contained some of the most visually striking animation ever put to screen. It broke new ground when it came to how animated films are presented and filmed. It is a testament to the quality of Across the Spider Verse that it actually manages to improve upon the art design of it's predecessor while still keeping the genuinely unique style that made the first film so beloved. Almost every shot in Across the Spider-Verse could be framed in a painting. The dazzling visuals are so rich with detail that they often feel as though they pop off the screen.In addition, the extraordinary use of colour in the film in regards to the action and storytelling is absolutely spectacular. The action sequences are also so fast paced and dynamic that they can feel almost overwhelming. However, the stellar art design is nowhere near the only thing that makes this film so good.The characters and story are both remarkably well written and relatable. The characters are likeable with complex motivations and are brought to vivid life by an exceptionally talented voice cast. Moreover, the dialogue between characters is smart, witty, and flows incredibly well.The story is also a significant improvement from Into the Spider-Verse. It understands the core themes and values of Spider-Man as a character and knows exactly how to challenge, subvert, and build upon them in inventive ways. The story grounds the breathtaking action and otherwordly plot in human emotion which greatly contributes to making the film feel immersive and personal for the audience.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a generationally great superhero film. With its awe-inspiring visual style, memorable characters, clever dialogue, and emotional rollercoaster of a story, it is an instant classic and a must see for any Spider Man fan.",positive

872,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night and picks up a few months after where the first film left off. Miles is getting ready for college, adjusting to being a hero and still keeping his secret from his parents. In Gwen's universe, she hasn't been so lucky as a hero and her dad has discovered her identity and turned against her. She is discovered by a group of Spider-man heroes across universes that are trying to fix the Spider-verse from the events of the first film. With no home to go to, Gwen is anxious to join the team and see Miles again, maybe her last true friend. Meeting Miles again may make the Spider-verse problems worse...This movie is codirected by Joaquim Dos Santos (Legend of Corra), Kemp Powers (Soul) and Justin K. Thompson (directorial debut). This contains the voices of Shameik Moore (Dope), Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out), Oscar Isaac (Moon Knight), Issa Rae (Insecure) and Shea Whigham (American Hustle).The writing for this movie is magnificently intricate. The depth of the characters, their families and their perspectives are so well delivered. How different families are and how that impacts a persons outlook is well told. The amount of characters in the storyline is impressive and how it all works fits perfectly. It never feels like characters for the sake of characters, but that every character plays a part in the series of events. Every time you think you understand what is happening and why in the storyline, a new loop is thrown in, some that rips at your heart strings, some that makes you cheer and some that makes you wonder if the loops will ever close. The animation is magnificent on so many levels - there is a realism in the characters, but the backdrops are artistic and stylish. The diversity in this is unmatched, authentic and the realism is impressive.Overall, this is the greatest Spider-man movie ever made and I can't wait for the next one. I would score this a 100/10 and strongly recommend it.",positive
873,"The movie is drawn beautifully, but that doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. It just shows how there are no new ideas and you are just adding some crazy stuff that won't make sense in the end. Why don't you be creative for the one time in your life and make up something that isn't just a toy for zombie people who don't understand the meaning of the art and how it should affect each person.This movie has a perfect body but it also has no soul. Like everything you can se today when you open your little phones. I probably won't be watching the next movie. Even though it doesn't matter because there are enough people fooled by big industries of today's world that will be thrilled to see bunch of animachions that will amaze them like a baby gets amazed by a picka boo game.",positive
874,"A pure bath into art, music, action. Real entertainment, and good screenwriting. Finally a Marvel's marvel. I am usually not a fan of the (too many) Marvel movies but this one is outstanding and above all the others. The animation, the art, the music, the story, everything is beyond cool. I was expecting something good but I am mesmerized. Amazed by how they could pull this off, at this level of quality and consistency throughout the whole movie. Even the story is good, the screenwriting. Emotional, fun, exciting, this is how modern cinema should be. It's been years since I wasn't genuinely excited like this in a movie theatre.",positive

This time Spider-Man and his friends are up against a spotted villain and an army of Spider-Men across the Spider-Verse. Just as you thought CGI animated movies would rule this decade this kind of animation as seen in this movie and others like Mitchell VS the Machines you will be amazed to see the animation from the city scapes, the holograms, the Spider-verse and so on.

The dedication to the animation was amazing and what all animated movies should strive for, this movie brought me eternal joy.Also the ending was interesting, the movie ended abruptly and i was expecting more, and i waited and there was nothing. The fact you left us on a cliffhanger is insane. I needed and craved more towards the ending, but it just ended suddenly, i will admit i was very angry at this horrific ending, there were so many stories unfinished, and now i have to wait 2 years for the next movieðŸ’” but that's okay, animation takes time, and i'm just excited to see how things end in the next movie.",positive

The film takes the first film and outdoes it on every single thing! This film is bound to be one of the biggest films of 2023 and in comic-book and animated films!

Even the first part was better than this cartoon. I don't see anything good here: the graphics are very bad, making my eyes hurt; the plot is quite monotonous and boring; There is no musical accompaniment, there is not a single memorable track. In the first part there was at least some soul, but here there is nothing! I hope people will reconsider their attitude towards this project, but in general there are much better films and cartoons about Spider-Man. This is my opinion, and many will agree with it! Bad movie!",negative

From the beginning you are totally trapped in the seat, you can't look away or blink, you can't Spider-Punk, Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man India, Peter B. Parker and The Spot, they were really wonderful supporting characters, and the chemistry between Gwen and Miles is wonderful.People weren't kidding when they said Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 would be the antagonist of Miles. And honestly, only one Marvel movie has left me so blown away by the ending, and that was Avengers Infinity War, however, this movie it also leaves you exactly the same with the ending. It's not exactly like in Infinity War but it leaves a very similar taste in your mouth 10/10.",positive
883,"I have kept this review entirely spoiler-free:It has been five years since the at the time ground-breaking 'Into the Spider-Verse'. A film that arguably set the new standard for animation. I can confidently say that once again, a new standard has been set.There were moments where I found myself in genuine awe, enriched in the spider-verse and completely captivated by the universes constructed. This truly is a film for the ages and if the progressive nature continues within the franchise then we can only count ourselves lucky to have 'Beyond the Spider-Verse' due next year.Whether it be the colour scheme in each universe, the phenomenal voice acting or even just watching a basic spider-man function such as walking on walls either horizontally or upside down, it was all crafted and produced so meticulously and is genuinely sensational. It could be argued that there are hundreds of frames that could be deemed pieces of art.Yes, there are a plethora of new characters and cameos to keep an eye out on but on the whole, the new selection of main characters that are involved in the narrative feel well-placed, worthy of their introductions and leave you excited to see where their futures lie. Particular standouts are; Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya), Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac) and the Spot (Jason Schartzman).Like mentioned above, there are tonnes of cameos to see and far too many to notice completely upon the first and second viewings. I would call these easter eggs but does it count as an easter egg if it's in plain sight to be seen?All in all, Across the Spider-Verse is absolutely breathtaking. Please do this film justice and watch it on the biggest screen possible if you can. I cannot wait to add this to my collection of 4k films.",neutral
884,Amazing film. Couldn't find many flaws with the film Didn't expect them to be able to top the first film. It also linked back perfectly to the first film. The only thing I can think of that was better in the first film is the soundtrack. My favourite Spider-Man film so far. Perfect cliffhanger ending that sets up part 2 amazingly. Can't wait to see beyond the spider verse. Felt really bad for miles throughout the film and has the right to feel betrayed. The animation of the film was perfect. Especially with Gwen's universe and spider punk. Favourite scene of the film is probably the chase sequence. With it making it seem like miles was caught all the way till the end and escaping at the perfect time.9.5/10.,neutral
885,"The story, the animation, the colors everything about it just perfect. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute game-changer in the world of animation and superhero storytelling.One of the most striking aspects of this movie is its unparalleled artistry. The visual style combines vibrant colors, dynamic animation techniques, and a diverse range of art forms. Great characters, great visuals, great music you name it. This film's visuals is absolutely incredible and his definitely the most beautiful animation I've probably ever seen in a film.I would say this movie will make you feel every bit of emotion humanly possible. It does not have a single dry moment just love it highly recommend it.",positive
886,"After the brilliant Into the Spiderverse, I really had prepared myself for disappointment as thought no way can they match, replicate this magic in a bottle, really hope they do not tarnish the legacy. So with much relief - all the magic is back. A brilliant story, full of depth and character, while introducing a whole raft of new characters, new spider men (and women), and, well, cats! Never flags, while Miles is learning and dealing with so much. Was absolutely blown away - again. Would deserve a 10/10, and tbh it probably does, just the different animation styles can initially be a little overwhelming, at least at first, but you do get used to them after repeat viewings. Which also helps as you take in the numerous background characters which are filled with nostalgia for those of us who were SM readers. Frustrating in a very small way of course that it is only half of the story, but then you are so happy that this will mean more hours of brilliance. Just wish part 2 was ready now! And incredibly uplifting at the end when a new team is forming with some new and some returning characters from Into. Damn, too long to wait!!! Yep, probably really should be a 10.....",neutral
887,"I just finished watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and it was Absolutely Breathtaking! The story was about equal to me in terms of how heartfelt the plot was, but the grand scope of it was definitely multiplied by ten. The themes were more ingrained into where the average person could realistically relate to said motivations. The animations were somehow even more crisp than Into the Spider-Verse! The artistic direction/cinematography of the sequel just flowed flawlessly in every frame. The special effects were wonderful. The music just like in the first movie was amazing. The voice acting was SPOT-ON. Get it haha?! And my favorite character was definitely Miguel O'Hara AKA Spider-Man 2099! Miguel O'Hara was the MVP of this sequel IMO and Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse is gonna SLAP HARD AF!",positive
888,"Marvellous film with no doubt. I loved the themes ,the new characters,the voices acting and the story all of it .I enjoyed every moment of the film and the family part about miles and his parent is so great and the conversations between them that show how miles loves his parents and how they do too .The relationship between miles and Gwen is gorgeous and lovely .The villain and how he glows up from a funny weak one to a multiverse transporter and dangerous one too .It really worth waiting 5 years however it ends up with an ending that that cannot be waited for to see what come next .It is really nice film .",positive
889,"I was expecting not to expect something, but I wasn't expecting That!!This is such a well written movie totally packed with emotions, splendid visuals and crazzyyy multiverse content. The way they are taking the story forward is absolutely in an unimaginable track! Loved how they are not wasting a single minute even after showing several backstories.You can watch this film over and over and find new new things. The movie is completely packed and every frame is superb!Nowadays, people would have already guessed the plot before the movie comes out. But this time its different!Only negative is that now we have to wait for the third one!",positive
890,"Across the Spider-Verse does what every great sequel does: it expands and builds on what came before. What came before was one of the greatest animated films ever made so this is just somehow, mind-breakingly, more of that. It's an almost indescribably artistic endeavour, from the kaleidoscopic drifts through different mediums to the action scenes so meticulously crafted that if a minute-long clip somehow got blasted through time onto YouTube a decade ago it would have destroyed society. The only flaw in this cavalcade of breathless, hilarious, heartfelt, comic-tickling, spider-loving majesty is potentially my fault, in that I went into this not knowing it ends in a massive cliff-hanger, which left me irritated and wishing they'd stuck with original plan to have ""part 1"" in the title.",positive
891,"In 2018,I first time met Miles in a Spiderman animation movie. I was shocked. This is what I imagined the movies looks like,all the pictures and music were hit the spot. Till 2023,Across the spider-verse come into the cinema. I rushed to cinema as fast as I can. The stories smooth and visual perception are intense. It solved all the issues that had been buried in intro the spider-verse.But all this movie seems like a trailer for the next spider-verse. Also,the music in this movie ain't perfect as the previous. Metro's compositions weren't really suitable in some places. I still love Post Malone's compositions on previous,all the music notes were on the spot. Really awesome.Otherwise,this movie still can be my top love movie in 2023.",positive
892,"Everything in the film was perfect , the music , the animation , the story , everything , the few criticisms I have for the film are not for the film but for the Pt / Pt dubbing otherwise a wonderful and perfect experience.Spoilers: The fact that the ending was open was perfect, making everything more intense, Spot as a villain even though he didn't appear in a large part of the film, he was also perfect and Miguel having a lot of mystery and history behind it was incredible. The secondary characters are also all amazing with special mention to spider punk. Miles is now extremely traumatized with a lot to deal with in the next movie, so I say the movie is perfect.",positive
893,"Goddamn, this movies is incredible. From the art and the animation, to the music, and the story, to everything, it hit hard. The multiverse is truly realize and it grander than the last movies but what at heart, is miles personal story. His connection to his family, Gwen, and all the other character, and him growing up, wanting to figure out where he fit in life. It never forget that, that what it truly make it unique. If I had to say one bad thing is that it end so abruptly and leave you wanting more, but to be honest, this is a nitpick. Okay one last thing, if you are a spider-man, which you are obviously, all the other spider-man easter and reference is truly incredible. Might be the best spider-man movies, and even mcu movies, it that good but I don't about mcu one, need more time thinking. What are you doing, go watch it, it a masterpiece 10/10.",positive
894,"I just really had an experience of reading a comic literally, a new and amazing experience of animation. The screenplay writing and the story were so strong, simple and elegant. The scenic and the animation can be give a 200 perevnt kudos. The indian reference intros , and I hope miles morales get a human shape and bring in MCU somehow. He is such a charm and a powerful character . One of the powerful spiderman. There are many wow, scenes must watch, missed in theater but surely u wont disappointed in TV as well, tat much good. You would love this if u r a comical lover. Everyone did their role to perfect, miles morales u rock. Please do watch it available in netflix. My concern, it ended up with no end unlike the first part, could have been a completion. But anyhow waiting for next part , beyond. It deserves an oscar for the beat anime movie.",positive
895,"The reason why i cannot give this 1 Stars is cause of its visuals and animations, but the movie felt cringe and tedious from the start. It felt like they weren't sure themself where to go with the plot for this sequel and it ended up being a goofy knockoff of a Rick and Morty citadel episode. Things that work for Rick and Morty and some of the marvel movies, do not work at all here tho, it felt cheap, uninspired and over the top. Idk, usually im a fan of such concepts and plots... maybe this movie was just not for me... Had to force myself to watch it till the end and that rarely happens to me, even with very bad movies.Ending on a gigantic cliffhanger and not even able to close the movie in itself does not make things better at all... Just confirmed my initial apprehensions about them being unsure/uninspired with this. Even for a trilogy this ending felt cheap, look at Infinity War or the New Mission Impossible on how to end a movie leaving room for more, but still closing out its own storyline kinda. Even if they manage to pull all the strings together for the next movie, this one will stay ultimately flawed, not sure if im even interested in watching the next one.Seriously would like to give 1 Star, just because of how massively overrated and overhyped this movie is, but out of respect for the animation team and everyone that was working on visuals/design etc. (instead of the storyline) i will not and for the sake of the few entertaining moments am giving it an honest 3/10 despite massive disappointment for this one.",negative
896,"It's only been out 1 week and I've already seen it twice. It's just as innovative in the animation sense as the first one. Everything they did in this movie they did beyond perfectly. The pacing, the humor, the animation, the action, the characters. And the emotional aspect of it is done so well, it's crazy. It feels so emotionally deep and realistic and combined with the beautiful art makes it pushed past perfection. Deserves to be in the run for best picture during the Oscars, and might as well be the best movie I've ever seen. Can't wait for the next one, because if they can top this one, they've made the best trilogy of all time.",positive
897,"This movie was a huge step up from the first one. The visuals were fantastic, much more of those that the first had. It definitely deserves Greatest Picture of The Year in my opinion. The story was amazingly paced, the music was absolutely amazing, better than the first. The storyline in general was just PHENOMENAL. The Spot was an amazing villain although we didn't see much of him, but i am very excited to see him in part 2. The cameos were also super fun, it was like looking for hidden Easter eggs in every scene. Everything about this movie far surpasses the first. The only complaint I have about this movie is that Miles didn't have a Leap of Faith moment, but nonetheless, the movie was amazing and extremely fun to watch. You can't give detailed reviews as I was going to give it a 9.8/10 but that's basically a 10/10 so lets just say that. In conclusion I highly recommend watching this movie, and I suggest actually going to see it at the cinema instead of watching it at home, because the experience is most definitely worth it. Great movie, Picture of the Year Worthy.",positive
898,"Great movie. I loved it. It was so fun and amazing and had the best animation I've ever seen. I loved the voice acting, the humor, the story, the action, the soundtrack.... Truly a masterpiece. To think some people who ENJOYED this movie are still giving it bad reviews anyway. Best Spider-Man movie. Maybe even best animated movie. Even better than the first movie no doubt. I loved all the different spider-people in the movie. Spider-punk, Jessica drew, spider-Gwen, spider-man 2099, Spider-man India, miles morales... what a spectacular cast of characters. Truly breathtaking. Not to mention the spot. The spot was awesome.",positive
899,"The intro was great, it was animated very well throughout the whole movie. The character and the collaboration of this movie was awesome! Even the music was super good, lots of meaning was put into the music and it also enhanced the scene. Plot was amazing, conflict very unexpected. Love the new villain, so OP, the animation of Spot was amazing. Also there was many funny scenes which can make audiences enjoy the film more. Background scene and everything was think carefully which can bring more emotions to the film. The color and contrast in the film was amazing, it caught my eyes. Idk what to write anymore cuz it might spoil the film.",positive
900,"Its very sad to know that the best marvel movie after endgame is not even a complete marvel production, after watching this my faith in the super hero genre is restored. Big thanks to sony for giving us this movie, after the disappointment i felt watching the phase 4 of marvel, this movie is so much refreshing, this is what every marvel movie should be, this is what multiverse should be.This is the marvel i want to see and appreciate. This is the marvel i grew up watching, This is the marvel which made me a fanboy.Marvel please learn from this , we fans have a lots of expectation and hope.DON'T LET US DOWN.",positive
901,"This movie was the best comic book movie ever it it just didn't reach my expectations in expanded beyond them I never thought that the spot would be the main villain in seeing the first Spider-Man TV show a Lego Spider-Man, the cashier woman from venom and even Aaron Davis as the prowler, but most of all I love seeing Spider-Man PS4 add the spectacular Spider-Man, but it was the best comic book movie ever and it was a 10 out of 10. It was better than the dark Knight or no way home and they did the same thing as bringing Andrews Spider-Man losing Captain Stacey and was shot. You can see Tobey Maguire, Spider-Man, losing uncle Ben and the spectacular Spider-Man losing uncle Ben too. The scarlet spider was spectacular and spider punk was portrayed amazingly. I loved it as my child.",positive
902,"I went into the movie with the belief of expecting the same level of amazingness that into the spider-verse delivered , but i can't stress this enough,i couldn't get more of the movie , by the time I realised the movie was over , it was dons. The movie was so smooth just like a magical masterpiece that told an amazing story better than its predecessor. It did not feel forced not a single time , i was so engrossed in the movie that when the movie was over was like ""that's it?"" And that's to say say so much about the movie, it kept me super invested in the story and and it was movie that will discover so many layers the more you see it.",positive
903,"This movie has a horrendously bad art style. The main character endorses treating people poorly, based on their skin colour. The other character supports youngun delusion and bad physical stuff happening to them. This movie is an ugly pile of garbage, that feeds on Marvel audiences low expectations and desire for action over substance.If you like the art style (or do not mind it) and choose to ignore the harmful messaging, you might like this movie.This movie is only the first part of a two-parter; so, it remains to be seen if these story flaws get rectified in the second half of the story. It is better than some other Marvel projects, though.Terrible Messaging and terrible art style.",negative
904,The film Is visually stunning with a well thought storyline. It is stacked full of very talented voice actors who play their role perfectly in the film. From start to finish it's full of action and their is small little details for a film watcher. It is fast paced and music/soundtrack is amazing. I like it features many real life scenes with many different spidermen in the film. For example Andrew Garfield Spiderman and Toby Maguire as well. I also liked how it the fact it had the MCU prowler as well. There will be loads of little Easter eggs I would of missed as well that allows you to want to watch the film again and again. Overall this is the best comic film ever.,positive
905,"It is a masterpiece, just the best piece of media I have seen in years from Marvel. Well I would like to say it is perfect but one thing is not the humor. The humor is not as good as the first and, well I don't think it makes it worse, I just think it is a little of a let down. But after 4 years of waiting it was worth it to see Miles and Gwen and Peter. And there is just so much in the movie and I wish it didn't end when it did. You have SO MANY great characters such as The Spot and Spider Punk. Every single moment is special and amazing and I will be looking forward too the Beyond the Spider-Verse. And I would say it was worth the wait 10 times over, and it was better then the first but the first still did some things better.",positive
906,"Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is a stunning and heartfelt adventure that will captivate you from start to finish. It combines stunning visuals, emotional depth, and a mind-blowing plot that takes you to new dimensions of storytelling. It is a cinematic masterpiece that you don't want to miss on the big screen. ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE surpassed all of my expectations. It is more moving and exhilarating than the first one, with a groovy soundtrack and dazzling animation. Oscar Isaac steals the show with his voice performance. It is a bold and rewarding setup for what's next. The cliffhanger ending will leave you breathless and eager for the sequel.",positive
907,"Trust me when i say those 2 and something hours are going to fly! It's such a gorgeous and fun movie you don't get tired of it, more than likely you'll crave for more as soon as it ends.The various art forms and styles throughout the film were amazing and pretty to look at, from paintbrushes to comic-like, from LEGO animation to live-action footage, it makes you want to rewatch it just for the artistic work they have put into the movie.The story is engaging, and diverges from the traditional superhero movie story, the villain is entertaining and very intimidating, the motivation for the plot of the movie to happen plays very well with Spiderman's lore throughout all different Earths that Marvel has created ever since the superhero has been introduced.So far, without a single doubt, it's my pick for the Best Animated Feature for all the Awards it should be nominated for.",positive
908,"This film was so incredible I have so many yet no words all at once. The storyline(s) and characters were so incredibly written and put across but still having the main focus on miles, as well as more of gwen. I don't remember much of the first film but it didn't matter because they gave us enough backstory to work off of and the plot could stand alone itself!Absolutely loved the diversity as well, along with the hilarious jokes from each different form of spider-man in their respective universe.Everything came together so well and the interconnection between all of the spideys and their so-called cannon events was just so clever. Can't wait for the second part I was left sobbing screaming and literally clawing my seat for more - what a cliffhanger!!With a collective of emotional, funny, and action moments this film is so well rounded and the animation and soundtrack really top everything off to create such a masterpiece.",positive
909,"Set 16 months after the events of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Across the Spider-Verse sees Miles Morales settling into his life as both Miles the son and student and Earth 1610's Ultimate Spider-Man. After reuniting with Gwen Stacy, Miles is introduced to the concept of the multiverse, encountering Spider-Men of different dimensions. Upon meeting Miguel O'Hara, a clash of ideologies finds Miles at odds with every other Spider across the web. On his own, Miles has to find a way to thwart the Spider-Verse to save the ones he loves most.Featuring the return of the main vocal talent of the first Spider-Verse film, Across the Spider-Verse has given the actors the opportunity to further explore the characters and this deepening of understanding has resulted in richly layered performances. Shameik Moore continues to delight as Miles Morales, less precocious than his initial outing and more fully inhabiting the role of your typical middle teenager attempting to navigate life while adhering to the 'great power/great responsibility' ethos that inhabits all who don the Spider mantle. Moore still continues to charm both the characters and the audience while also handling the weighty elements. Similarly, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy shoulders a large slice of the drama as well. With the story's opening focusing more on her (this is just as much her movie as it is Miles'), Steinfeld rises to the challenge, giving us a conflicted Gwen that pulls Miles into a larger world. Oscar Isaac is properly menacing as Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099, the most tortured and driven member of the Spider collective. This is Isaac as unhinged as he's been in a film, animated or otherwise, and seeing a new facet of his performance is exhilarating.Unfortunately, Isaac's O'Hara is almost a little too effective. His introduction into the movie near the halfway point completely overshadows the film's main villain The Spot, voiced by Jason Schwartzman. Starting out with a villain-of-the-week status before graduating to something more sinister, he's instantly likeable at the film's outset as a minor nuisance, pulling petty jobs to survive. His growth in stature might be one of the few weak points of the story; too much attention is paid to Miles and his various relationships to both his parents and Gwen, and not enough to The Spot. Spinning out of the events of the first Spider-verse film in a way that doesn't seem ham fisted, The Spot's back story is solid enough but his leveling up through the movie seems more an afterthought than an element worth focusing on.In a number of instances when a project has multiple credited writers and multiple credited directors, that can spell disaster. Too many cooks in the kitchen is an oft quoted phrase and for the most part it's true: even when well intentioned, clashing ideologies, differing interpretations of the source material, and personal wishes can collide to create a final product that's unbalanced or downright sloppy. Such isn't the case with Across the Spider-Verse; the combined talents of Phil Lord, Chris Miller, David Callaham, Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson are in near perfect harmony, delivering a story that manages to balance character work and action. While differing animation styles coexisting on the screen may seem jarring at first, the blend is done in such a way that allows the characters to inhabit the same space while highlighting their origins. From a technical standpoint, this film will be the one all other animated stories chase. From a narrative focus, while not as enriching as the first movie, the writers have set the bar for an emotionally charged, high stakes sequel.Overall, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is easily one of the year's most creative and entertaining films. Again, Lord and Miller, along with David Callaham, have provided a story that is not only wildly creative, but remembers to keep the characters and their relationships at the center of everything. With great vocal work from the returning cast, as well as the addition of Oscar Isaac, Jason Schwartzman, and Issa Rae, Across the Spider-Verse has set the standard for animated films going forward.",positive
910,"It's an entertaining movie, a bit complicated but really overrated by the critics, it's not a masterpiece, far from that, on one level this storytelling tries to please everyone a big issue for me, maybe a lot of people confuse the overstimulation graphic with the development of the plot... I liked the character of the villain, although the origin is a crude copy of the origin of the villain from ""Spiderman Far from home""
An excellent movie for teenagers who live overstimulating all day on their iPhones, but a headache for fathers and mothers who take their children under 10 years old hoping for something simpler and easier to digest.This movie is a bit too much of everything... Visual Overstimulation, effects, plot etc... it is undeniable that it has awesome graphics, a good sequence in the growth of Mick Morales's character, it has its good moments... but in the end. .. after the first movie, I felt a little bit disappointed.",positive
911,"""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a phenomenal movie and something that was never seen before. This statement is not exaggerated in any way or form since the animation styles and how they are used to enhance scenes are unprecedented. I recently saw again its predecessor (""Into the Spider-Verse"") and the step up in terms of art and budget is very noticeable. If the first one was still creative and innovative while translating a comic into a movie, this one is the same but under steroids. This is because the animation style changes between the various universes but most importantly it changes with the emotions of the characters, it follows and enhances dialogues being able to enrich many interactions between characters. Only because of its artistic nature I think this movie deserves a watch in the best theatre you know.It's not only spectacles however. The characters are great and the dialogues between them are able to create very interesting dynamics, that leads to fun, frenetic, sad and emotional moments. With respect to the previous movie the stakes are bigger and you feel more the impact of every choice and every twist, but I think that the first one was tighter and more focused. Yes, it was simpler but as a single movie it had everything you can ask plus some memorable scenes like the ""what's up danger"" one. And from this I can introduce why ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is not a 10/10 and is, in my opinion, a small step behind the first one (for now). First of all there is what I previously mentioned as a bit less focused plot, but in addition to that the pace is not as consistent due to slightly too long beginning and ending. In addition the ending is not there since the final scene of this movie is a big and hard cliffhanger. I knew it was a part one of two, but I hoped it was more in line with something like Infinity War and Endgame or Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi. So I can't say that a truncated film is a perfect 10/10 or better than a masterpiece like the the previous chapter. But as far as the peaks ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is second to no one, simply majestic.If the third instalment will be able to close properly the story (and after the first two I am quite confident it can) and be at the same level of the first two, we will could be in front of one of the best trilogy in cinema history. A trilogy in which each part was consistently phenomenal. Let's hope for the best. In the meantime I'm eager to re-watch this one again and again and again.",positive
912,"A I've heard about Into the spider-verse for a long time and yet haven't seen it. Until Across the spider-verse arrived. So I decided to watch it. After watching ITSV keep asking myself' Where Am I?' After watching ITSV for 8 hours Now I'm ready for ATSV. When I walked out the cinema was shocked. Ok Sony this one is PHENOMENAL! Ran out of words after watching it. It's completely an art on the big screen without any doubts. You can't look away from the screen for a second. This movie is in another level of animation now. Every frames are absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Every characters are full of heart. The story is beyond my expectations and I'm sure that yours too. Just three words for it ""I Love It"" If you love spiderman(s), If you love Marvel, If you love animation, If you love Movies or If you are a guy spending your time at the cinema every weekend like me.",positive

Emotional, heartfelt, sincere, insane wacky and yet tied all together. Lord and Miller did it again. Each one of their projects have been one of the most satisfying films I've ever seen and this one is no exception.Moreover, the entire team that put this film together has truly made something very special. Somehow presenting story beats that are very familiar and yet in ways that are surprisingly unexpected.Every frame of this movie is a treat to enjoy.

Nevertheless, the moment it hits the cinemas next year I am booking myself a seat!10/10, please make more amazing movies like this! Fantastic job!",positive
916,"I don't think there could have been a better sequel than Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. I had been wanting to see the movie for the past one month, ever since it came out. But each time it was either houseful, or it wasn't being screened around me because who would watch ""a children's movie"", because that's what animated films are, right? But I finally got the opportunity to watch it at a screening which was early in the morning. And I'm so glad I did this.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse begins where the prequel left off: Miles waking up when Gwen calls his name from a portal. The difference this time being that we know the context behind the scene - Miles is grounded for not coming to his father's party on time. His father has become the captain, so he had thrown a party but Miles was busy fighting a new enemy, Spot. Spot has holes all over his body, which allow him to go through one place and come out of another. This power helps him transport into different places, including universes.The movie began with Gwen and was getting very emotional, so I was scared this might not be as funny as Into the Spider-Verse was. But as the scene changes to Miles, it goes all-out hilarious. Since Spot has made into the multiverse and is upset that Miles didn't take him seriously, he vows to take his revenge. This will be done when he killes Miles' father after he becomes a captain. And now that there are many Spider-people out there, they will stop Miles from stopping Spot. Although I have marked this review Spoiler, I won't tell why because someone might have accidentally decided to read this review before watching the movie. One thing that I will tell you about it is that it ends on a cliffhanger, and the next movie's name is Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.Just about everything in this movie is perfect - the art style, the story, the action sequences, the comic timing, the fan service - literally everything. And the surprise in the end, although it was predictable that Miles is going to Earth-42, it still managed to create a doubt in my mind for a long time. Until of course, it was revealed that my guess was right. It wasn't even predictable actually, since it actually writes that on screen for a split-second when Miles is teleporting to his universe.The addition of new characters and updation of the old ones was handled excellently. Pavitra Prabhakar was never shown in the first trailer, and yet he was shown a lot in the promotional videos. I was thinking this is only being done to promote the movie in India, but it turned out it was absolutely right. Pavitra Prabhakar has a minor and yet a very major role in the plot. Peter B. Parker's daughter was so adorable as the Spider-baby, I could very well understand why Peter wanted Miles to hold her before talking.I really liked the movie very much and although it's a sad fact that we will have to wait very long for Beyond the Spider-Verse, I would like it to take as much time as it wants, as long as the end result is a movie that lives up to the same expectations and this one did. The prequel, this and the PS5 game are the reasons why Miles Morales has been accepted into the society so quickly; because he deserves to. I hope his quality remains intact like this for as long as I live.",positive
917,"Spoiler: the first half is a fun teenage comedy, with a very promising idea for a villain. There are multiple hilarious jokes, but it becomes obvious pretty soon, that there is a serious lack of plot.Second half feels like there is a microscopic change in direction, now it is no more the teenage stuff but spectacular spider-splatter instead. Does it do any good for the experience? No, I'd say not. A few funny jokes still happen to come across, but it degenerates continuously from now, as is the optic of the film changing from blurry to blurrier.IMO this film suffers the desease of many of sequels: overambitious expectations to outwit and overtop an already formidable predecessor leading to the exact opposite result.",positive
918,"It was FANTASTIC, a total amazing experience, the animation, the characters, the plot, EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. I literally enjoy it so much that I didn't feel the time go by until the to be continued.. apear in the scream. I recommend this masterpiece film to everyone, it's really a piece of art. In a few cases seconds parts are better than first ones but I can assure that in this case it was, the second part surpasses the fist one, above all in the animation, draw and style of the movie, all was draw so originally (the characters and the backgrounds). How I said in the headline, I think the last superhero move I really enjoy this much was the first of this trilogy.",positive
919,"I loved the first movie Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018); it was what I loved about the comics, what I love about animation, and what I love about Spider-Man. I absolutely loved the new sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023); it was everything I loved about the first film if not more than the first film knowing it took five years to make this, and how much work was put into it.Shameik Moore as Miles Morales was once again amazing as the character; you understand what he Is going through when having issues with his parents that can be relatable, and when he is going across the Spider-Verse having a whole Spider-Society coming after him for certain reasons (which was shown in the trailer). Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy/Spider-Gwen was also still great; her and Miles both have a nice chemistry, and Gwen is having problems herself involving her dad and other things involving the Spider-Verse that was compelling and felt real.The many variations of Spider-Man were amazing to see; like Pavitr Prabhakar/Spider-Man India played by Karan Soni who did a wonderful job as the character by being funny and giving the character's origin in an entertaining way. Hobie Brown/Spider-Punk played by Daniel Kaluuya was a cool character who had a unique animation style and had a cool personality with an origin story that was entertaining and interesting. Jessica Drew/Spider-Woman played by Issa Rae was a cool mentor for Gwen Stacy and had a lot of good action scenes along with Ben Reilly/Scarlet Spider who looked cool but was funny in the movie. And lastly Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099 played by Oscar Isaac, who was awesome seeing in the movie; looking cool and intimidating either in action scenes or when he is just talking to other characters, and he has a backstory to him that was sad but made you understand him and what he is doing.The main villain named Spot played by Jason Schwartzman was an exceptionally good villain; what I liked about him was that he seemed like a villain of the week character that was funny, until he becomes a major threat to the Spider-Verse with his ability to pull spots off his body and use them as portals. He does have a reason to hate Miles Morales by having a backstory that connects to the first movie in a very funny way. Going from villain of the week to big threat was interesting, but I liked what they did with him by making him seem like a side character but gradually turning him into a main foe they must try and deal with some way.The animation is once again phenomenal to watch; I still love the comic book style, but I especially loved the different animation styles of each dimension with each version of Spider-Man having a cool, unique, stylized, and creative look to them that was fantastic to watch. Every single version of Spider-Man is either from a Spider-Man comic book, video game, animated show, or movie that are part of the movie or just a cameo, plus I liked seeing Peter B. Parker played by Jake Johnson in the movie with Peter's young daughter Mayday Parker. Every dimension was beautiful to look at; Spider-Gwen's dimension was pretty with a unique color palette that makes the backgrounds look like they were painted, Spider-Man India's dimension Mumbattan had an interesting design and was pretty to look at, a glimpse into Spider-Punk's dimension looked like magazine cutouts animated together in a creative way and Spider-Man 2099's dimension Nueva York looked big in scale and cool with the future technology, plus some uses of live-action and other styles.Because this movie is a part one it ends with a cliffhanger, so I will say, without spoilers, that the cliffhanger will make you hyped for the second part by the time the phrase ""to be continued"" shows up on screen, plus I liked how the topic of what it means to be Spider-Man is used. I loved Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023) even more than the first, but I still love the first film; this movie is funny, it has fantastic animation, great characters, a great score, and soundtrack, with effective emotional and intense scenes, and a lot of cameos fans will recognize. As soon as the movie ended, and I left the theatre I wanted to watch the movie again, along with it being a fun two hour and twenty-minute-long ride that does not feel long at all.",positive
920,"I love this movie so much. It's visually stunning with a variety of animation styles that interact with each other in new and fascinating ways. Unlike the first movie, I feel it leans into the action more than emotion, there are heartwarming moments between Miles and many of the people he's close with. Yet the lack of emotionally impactful scenes does not at all hinder the performance or overall arc of it's story. Spider-man: Across the Spider-verse, like it's first installment, was truly a masterpiece of fiction, and broke even more grounds when it comes to animation.Seeing the way Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse inspired animated movies to present with more inventive and stylized ways of animating such as Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Mitchells VS The Machines, The Bad Guys, Mutant Mayhem, and many more animated titles the past few years, I can only imagine what the animation industry could look like in the future.",positive
921,"It was perfect, the way the movie told the story and the ending was amazing. For me it was a masterpiece. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
""It's hard to think of a recent movie that has had a bigger impact on the film industry then 2018's Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Not only was it a highly unique comic book movie that came out at the height of the MCU's popularity, but also established a distinctly different style of animation that's since been used in other popular animated films. It was a trailblazer of a film that seemed impossible to follow up since the original was already near flawless so it was hard to imagine that the long anticipated sequel would somehow surpass it. Yet, that's precisely what ended up happening. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse didn't just double down on all the incredible elements that made the first film so truly spectacular, it tripled (if not quadrupled) down to make for an invigorating continuation that pushes the boundaries of animation to an overwhelming breaking point. Speaking of, let's talk about the presentation first because it can't be overstated how much of a visual marvel this film is. The kaleidoscope of visually distinct yet beautifully contrasting art styles in this feature made this an optically arresting experience that I could not look away from. Every frame of this film is enriched with unimaginable details and dedicated passion with a cornucopia of vibrant colors that made this film look so good that it's hard to not shed a tear for the imagery alone. It highlights the frenetically dazzling set-pieces, elevates the plentiful moments of witty humor, and sprinkles in hundreds of references/easter eggs that will make future viewings even more fun. Yet, for all the lavish entertainment that this film offers, it never forgets about telling a thoroughly engaging story with both personal and universal stakes with layered characters that you earnestly care about. Part of this does come from the phenomenal voice acting from the ensemble of talent with not a single weak link in the entire cast. The main reason though is that the production takes its time to have its story patiently unfold in the background while keeping the spotlight on the hardship that the characters are going which makes them both endearing and relatable. Yet, despite the film's lengthy runtime of 140 minutes, it still moves at a perfect pace that knows when to speed up to throw some rapid-fire jokes at you and slow down to let the drama marinate. If I really had to nitpick something in this movie, I guess that we didn't need the heavy dump of exposition in the first act to remind us of what happened in the first film. Also, this film is decidedly a part one kind of film that ends on a huge cliffhanger so I suppose that this flick won't be completely satisfying until part two comes out next year. That doesn't change the fact that this feature floored me from start to finish, and I can't wait to see it multiple times before the conclusion. In short, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one of those rare movies that doesn't just meet the hype; it miraculously surpasses it! It weaves an expansive and ambitious web that's expertly spun together by a dramatically rich story that's populated by layered characters that you're fully invested in which is already enough to carry the feature. Yet, we're also treated to a staggering assault on the senses that celebrates the iconic web slinger with groundbreaking animation, stunning action sequences, hysterically clever humor, and an endless onslaught of references that will require multiple viewings to catch them all. It feels a bit redundant to call this one of the greatest comic book movies of all time since it managed to blow its spectacular predecessor out of the water. So all I can say is that Sony is just one movie away from making arguably the greatest comic book trilogy of all time. If your spidey sense isn't already tingling then swing on over to the theater as soon as possible to watch one of the best movies of 2023""!",positive
922,"Your an action fan....want some comedy....a little romance, drama, nostalgia, suspense a great hero/villain origin story? This movie delivers it all and add in the stunning visuals. You don't have to be a fan of Spider-Man to catch many of the hidden nuggets and not so hidden references to other Spidey movies. You will be mindlessly dipping your hand into your popcorn bucket as you hyper focus on all of the elements this movie offers. It's one of the few movies that when the house lights come up....and the credits start to roll...you take a moment and just go WOW! And then you go Awwwwwww! When you realize it says TO BE CONTINUED ðŸ˜…",positive
923,"Rainy melancholy in New York, vibrant streets of Brooklyn, this film employs an extremely cyberpunk color palette, with a mix of melancholic blues and seductive pinks that take the film's emotions to a realm of madness. This madness faithfully restores the wild imagery that was once confined to comic books, and the character's growth curve is truly classic, yet it avoids feeling clichÃ©.The intertwined fusion and conflicts of the characters, both prior to and following the events, possess a peculiar and vibrant life force that directly strikes at the core of your being-unleashing all that energy will transport you back to the person you once were, the one who fearlessly collided with the established rules of the world to witness the outcome. It's akin to a formidable quantum collider, forcefully crashing into the faces of all the characters involved, rekindling your spirit and reigniting the innate sense of adventure within you.In the last, for your own good, don't try to save money on this one. Treat yourself to the cinema and enjoy it. Trust me, you'll thank me later!""",positive
924,"Normally sequels are a downgrade from the first film but this sequel was a masterpiece. Spiderman into the spiderverse has always been one of my favourite films and this film now stands with it, if not higher. Before the film had even finished I had already decided this was the best animated film ever. The artwork is amazing it's like watching a two hour art-piece. The pacing was perfect, no scene felt unnecessary or too long. The voice acting captured the characters perfectly and the music was never too loud and overbearing. While being heartbreaking at some times it was also funny and lighthearted. Truely perfect.",positive
925,"I love movies. I even love bad movies. I am notorious amongst people who know me to find something I like in almost every movie I watch. So basically, I like 99.999% of all the movies I watch. I'm just easily entertained. What can I say?This movie, however, is definitely in my most hated movies of all time list. I've only ever turned off one movie. That was Battlefield Earth. I didn't turn this off because I was in the theatre with my family and I didn't want to be rude to my son, who is a big fan and throughly enjoyed it.I like Spider-man (Tobey forever!), but the first of this series, Into the Spider-Verse, didn't even impress me. The art style was quite odd and overstimulated my senses or something. Many people enjoyed said art, though, and so it made a triumphant return in this movie. It was just ten times worse with convoluted color palettes and random swatches that were more distracting than symbolic.Also, absolutely nothing happened in this movie. There was action and drama and such, but the story went exactly nowhere. Nothing was gained or even lost by anybody. The ending was entirely unfulfilling, completing no story arcs or subplots. It was like watching commuters pacing mindlessly to and fro. Even bad movies complete some kind of story arc.There are a few things that place it a single notch above Battlefield Earth. There are two references to other branches of the multiverse that I appreciate, probably mostly for nostalgic reasons. Plus, some of the music is pretty groovy. Other than that, this movie is a total bust for me. I'm just glad the kid liked it.TL;DR It's hard for me to hate a movie, but I hate this movie.",neutral
926,There is no movie like this spider verse saga the first one was cool but this this is a masterpiece! Lots of action comedy and beautiful new colours and characters this movie takes a special place in my heart. This is by far my favourite marvel movie and Spider-Man Miles Morales is my favourite superhero of all time. In this film we not only see him but a whole bunch of new versions of spider men and Mike tries to figure where in the huge universe does he fit in and the film ends on a very suspenseful ending that makes you want to see what happens next I can't wait till then but all I can say is this is a must see movie!! First watch the first one if you haven't already and you will not be disappointed.,positive
927,"Damn, this movie is amazing! The animation, the action, the characters, all of them add up to a sweet cheesecake full of delight and elegance!But, the movie does make you feel like your plate has been taken away when you haven't even finished, and now you gotta wait 9ish months to finish it.That is the main flaw, it's abrupt ending, which does make you wonder ""really?! There?!!"" But it's going to be worth the wait.The heart in this movie is so noticeable that you can't help but smile during every scene. Every character seems fleshes out and has a great, understandable backstory which makes you care about the characters within two minutes.Once the next movie comes out, this is gonna become a 10, unless it's really bad.",positive
928,"Spoilers aheadThis is honestly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen! The action and story line was incredible. If you are planning to watch this movie I would 100% recommend watching it in theatres. My favourite part was when miles saw himself and the end as the prowler and the cliffhanger at the end! Also watch out for the twist at the end! If you are going to watch this movie make sure to watch the previous movie that was released in 2018. The two movies have plenty to do with each other. Also, this movie has a few swear words for younger kids (a**, da*n, ect). I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did! Let's hope you SPOT this note :).",positive
929,"The original movie is one of my all time favorites, so I had high hopes for this one. I am absolutely BLOWN AWAY!! It was incredible, absolutely hilarious. I never knew what was coming next! I didn't want it to end, and I don't know if I can wait for the next one.I may have even liked it even better than the first, which I thought for sure wouldn't be possible! I absolutely adored all of the characters, especially Gwen. There was never a moment where I was bored, it had me captivated the entire time.Major thanks and congratulations to everyone who worked on this. Visually stunning, incredible story,
super funny, great pacing, and fantastic soundtrack. Just EVERYTHING about this movie was perfect in my eyes.I just have to reiterate how INCREDIBLE the animation is. It blew me away, even more so than Into The Spider-Verse. The art style for Gwen's parts especially was so beautiful, so many rich colors, and the line work! Wow!! As an artist, I found myself so entranced by it. I cannot wait to get the art book and just stare for hours.My theatre was screaming at the ending, and as much as I hate having to wait, I am SO GLAD it's being split into two rather than having everything rushed and messy. Every part of this movie was important to have, I can't imagine any of it being cut to make room for a second movie's worth of plot.Once again, well done to everyone who worked on this. I just sat in the theatre during the credits and took in as many names as I could. What an honor it must have been to work on this. I cannot wait to see what comes next.10/10!!!",positive
930,"This movie is hyper active and engaging! Super entertaining and packed with Easter eggs. This hyper stylization is a huge drive for the appeal of the spider verse movies and this installment doubles down on that. With that said, there is so much fast moving animation on screen that some moments are difficult to follow and I am surprised that there wasn't an epilepsy warning at the beginning lol. All in all, fantastic story with a lot of heart, perfect amount of humor, and amazing animation. Spider-Man fans, superhero fans, and comic book fans alike will all really enjoy this movie. Looking forward to seeing it again soon!",positive
931,"This sequel to Into The Spider-Verse takes the Marvel multiverse to a more extreme level with its colorful, surreal animation. This is already a clear preview of what awaits us in the Marvel multiverse if what we have already seen in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness was not enough. The film not only brings together different versions of Spider-Man seen in comics or video games, it also manages to create an implicit, but vast connection to the movies and series that have been made of Spider-Man over the years, among which are include the Spider-Man series (1967), Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends (1981), Spider-Man (1994), Spider-Man Unlimited (1999), The Sam Raimi Trilogy, The Amazing Spider-Man Saga , Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Venom (2018) The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008) and Ultimate Spider-Man (2012). This already makes it very clear that most of the movies and series that Marvel made for many years are part of a large multiverse. The film ends up being a tremendous visual spectacle that plays with colors and with different types of animated sequences, making it an amazing and surreal experience. Miles Morales' story is even taken to another level in this quest to find out if he's really meant to be Spider-Man. As much as it focuses only on the world of Spider-Man, it's another great amplification for the MCU and a masterpiece that lives up to its predecessor. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.",positive
932,"The scenerio is good obviously, graffics yes, but why i it so tiring to watch, so much going on in a second, too much color, too much speed, my eyes got tired while watching it biologically speaking, and i am a binge watcher mostly,, so if i say my eyes got f..ed up its really messed up. Soo this rate is what the movie deserve. And i dont get why people so obsessed with something if its popular. They dont even see it with their own perspektive, just repeat the majority's reaction thats stupid af. Dont be sheep have your OWN thoughts for once, is irritating too see someone talk the talk of same shtt.",positive
933,"Spider-verse was very good movie and the animation was pretty well made. There were many cinematography elements and different moods and shots that complimented the scenes. I learned a lot about film from this movie and I realized how important each detail was. The movie had a good plot and the characters were also very interesting. There were very good colors and it contrasted each other. I actually enjoyed this movie a lot and I think this was the best animated spiderman movie that has come out so far. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and I would definitely recommend this movie to others. If you like spiderman, you will definitely enjoy this movie.",positive
934,"I was so happy with this movie. It was one of the best Spider Man Movies ever, if not the greatest comic book movie of all time. They peaked with the animation, and the plot was beautiful. It surprises me to see that this movie could top No Way Home. But it did, and now I will never be the same. This is everything a Spider Man fan could want. Great cast, great plot, all around great movie. Definitely recommend. I love it so much, and it's easily my favorite movie. I am so glad to see this movie. If you're a Spider Man fan, watch it. If you're an animation fan, watch it. If you're a movie fan, watch it. Just watch it guys. It's truly amazing. (See what I did there?)",positive
935,"This movie was something else the animation,the music, visual and everything is perfect in it didn't expect the cliffhanger which makes it better and the ending with miles being in the wrong universe makes it even more stunning and kinda scary because at the last minutes of the movie the prowler miles make me drop my jaw and watching in schock and even the characters were so good example is Indian spider man, he was funny,engertic,and not that serious,hobie was a punk and revolutionary character that doesn't care he mostly helped miles the most in the movie,I also like the Easter eggs and the details in the movie and the villian was something else he really trying to make his life a hell cuz of a bagle
Overall 10/10 this movie was worth every second.",positive
936,"A couple years ago, I watched ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" without knowing much about what I was getting into; it didn't take long, though for me to be very much amazed by the idea, the animation, the music, the pace, the... well, everything, honestly.Yesterday, I went into the theater with an idea of what I was getting into, and with the highest expectations: it took me literally one minute to say to my brother ""I'm loving this already :)...."" . And that feeling stuck for the entire length of this truly great experience: truly great concept, characters, soundtrack, overall sound... well, everything, honestly ( I think I've said these words before :)... ) ... All this done in a way that kept me 101% interested the absolute entire time, which too often isn't the case.I'm a very big fan of animation, of very different sorts, and I've seen many things I liked quite a lot. These two installments of Spider-Man / Spider-Verse still easily find their way to be among the very top things I've seen, and not only animation-wise, I'm very very happy to say.I left the theater with a 'wow' + 'feel good' vibe which I so much appreciate and cherish due to how rare it is. Congrats to those involved who do this work with one main goal in mind: delivering these amazing feelings to the public.So yeah: congrats! And THANK YOU! :-)",positive
937,"Just got back from seeing this, it's a JURASSIC PARK-esque shift in movie making.It's easily the best animation ever made, perhaps a watermark in filmmaking. I say this as a filmmaker myself having worked on plenty of movies. It changes what we thought possible in storytelling - the use of Gwen's colour palette alone is a work of art in its own right. You have to see it to believe it.It could easily win best picture, best directing, best script, best editing, best VFX, best sound design, best production design, best acting? Maybe - IT IS THAT GOOD - I predicted ""Everything Everywhere"" would sweep the board last year so using my spidey sense here to predict big wins for this now :DMost of all, it has SOUL. Go see it for yourself. And don't blink or you'll miss something incredible.",positive
938,"I loved every single second of the film of the film truely a masterpiece of the decade. The story telling and overall character development was truely wonderful too see. The fact that the creators still care about the characters they create is beatiful too see. The film was hooking from the second it started to the very end is had me glued to my seat the whole time. The film also has some wonderful and clever knods to the original film,the animation as expected from sony was also wonderful and a perfect experience to watch as it always is. The music by Metro Boomin was on point, although sunflower was still better in the firat film, yet the sound track provided the film with some great music and vibe to the overall movie. So in conclusion 10/10 would recommend.",positive
939,"The animation is amazing. The attention to detail is incredible, and the characters are brought to life in a way that is both realistic and engaging. The environments are also beautifully rendered, and the overall visual experience is simply stunning.The music is perfect. The soundtrack is a mix of hip-hop, electronic and music that perfectly complements the action on screen. The songs are catchy and memorable, and they really help to drive the story forward.The action scenes are really good. The action sequences are well-choreographed and exciting. The characters move with fluid grace, and the battles are full of energy and excitement. The animation is top-notch, and the action scenes are sure to please fans of all ages.",positive
940,"I have to admit I've only seen the 'Home' Spiderman's with Tom Holland. And I loved those one's. I did completely skipped the first movie of this version. With that being said, I didn't enjoy this movie. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are pure gold but the storyline just wasn't interested.I was completely lost. There wasn't enough context given to a new viewer, which made it boring.I'm still scratching my head on why this movie is so highly ranked. It didn't even have a true ending. This is the first movie I've ever spent time on that didn't end. Would I watch the next continuation? No. I almost walked out on this one.",neutral
941,First of all this movie single handedly hand the most beautiful animation I've seen in my life from the city scapes to the character movement I have never seen anything like it. Next on the list was the soundtrack witch I will admit was not as good as the first but between the score and the Metro Boomin album the music was almost perfect. I think this movie did a magnificent job on its pacing from humor to emotion and had so much amazing character development between Miles and Gwen. But the best part of it is the ending which I won't spoil but I will say no one in the theater saw it coming. I was completely in awe watching this and seeing how it almost perfectly resembled a comic book as good or better than the first one.,positive
942,"Undoubtedly, at some point in our lives, we have all participated in a carnival or fair, where we find ourselves immersed in a vibrant and lively environment. That's the example I give when asked about ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"".The abundance of visual stimuli left me astonished, creating a situation where I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of visual attractions. It got to the point where I felt like I might miss the opportunity to appreciate numerous elements, as each one had such an irresistible charm that my mind struggled to discern which one to focus on. It was an extraordinary introduction that led me to a different perspective than what I had in mind based on the trailers. The movie unfolds at a remarkably appropriate pace, allowing the viewer to establish an emotional connection with the plot. Every five minutes of footage, we come across references that both fans and those who simply attended with nothing to do can appreciate, upholding the motto of ""anyone can be Spider-Man"".However, it's worth noting that the presence of familiar characters and brief fragments from other movies made me somewhat uncomfortable, as they seemed out of place, as did certain voice actors (This only applies to the Latin dubbing). One of the standout aspects, beyond the animation itself, was the movie's sequence. At no point did it feel boring or excessively fast-paced. In fact, my main concern was that it would adopt a ""classic"" resolution often found in animated and superhero films, where everything is resolved through the power of love and a simple wish. However, to my pleasant surprise, the movie took a completely opposite approach by implementing a cliffhanger, something that I couldn't mentally process at that moment. Additionally, the soundtrack played a crucial role in fitting perfectly with the scenes.Without further ado, I highly recommend going to a movie theater and indulging in this wonderful visual spectacle. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best animated films I have had the pleasure of witnessing, and one that I won't hesitate to watch again.",positive
943,How to even begin to describe how amazing this movie ended up being. I knew the trailers made it look good. But actually getting in was that much better. There was never a dull moment. So many cameos that made me so happy to see and some that were new to me and that makes me want to watch it again. I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I'll keep spoilers to myself. But the action packed twists and turns that I didn't expect added to the experience. I was absolutely shocked and I can't wait for the next one. I hope it keeps up the amazing momentum this one gave us. It even kept my 5 year olds attention the whole movie. I can't wait to buy it.!,positive
944,"Now a little older and more comfortable in his secret identity, Miles Morales is still the same bright, personable kid we left behind after Into the Spider-Verse. He excels at school, immerses himself in the arts and makes shallow private excuses for his web-slinging adventures, but also pines for his lost friends from divergent timelines. Particularly Gwen Stacey, the Spider-Woman of a parallel universe who took a little piece of his heart when they parted ways, seemingly forever, at the climax of the first film. Well, unsurprisingly, she's felt the same way about Miles all this time, and by imprudently using her new connections within the multiverse to drop in for a visit, she's set motion to a potentially reality-ending disaster. Or something. Honestly, it's a little convoluted.Although Sony has tried to match the formula several times in the interim, there's still nothing else that looks or moves quite like these Morales Spider-Verse films. Thoroughly hip and fresh, they flaunt their connections to the printed source while imbuing the screen with an up-tempo blast of contagious kinetic energy. It's impossible to sit still through this, or to watch without a dazzled grin on your face... at least, not if you have the slightest bit of appreciation for classic superhero comics. As this is a sequel, and thus not altogether fresh territory, I was no longer taken by surprise, but I also wasn't disappointed. The love and craftsmanship on display is top-shelf, from the bombastic color tones and exaggerated pinup poses in the foreground to the rich detail and Easter egg wealth that floods the scenery. It's a worthy theater spectacle, but also promises to be a rewarding Blu-Ray rewatch, particularly in frame-by-frame mode.That said, we do experience some growing pains. For the first hour and change, the new model is every bit as loose, free and energetic as the first. Then it gives in to the urge to get SERIOUS and CONSEQUENTIAL and the plot's home stretch quickly grows mired under the weight of it all. The story is far too ambitious, as this chapter runs for a heavy hundred-fifty minutes and doesn't wrap a single plot point, but the greater issue is its penchant for long, dry exposition at the cost of momentum. I don't want to watch Gwen and Miles screech to a standstill while the older heroes breathlessly explain things. I want to watch them laugh and joke, kick out the jams (great soundtrack btw) and strike anatomically-impossible poses as they fire webs from their wrists. Plenty of that in the first hour. Much less from that point forward.",positive
945,"Everything in this movie will keep you in your seat. I went into the movie expecting a movie that was just another Spider-Man movie, yet upon viewing, I couldn't forget about it. The first major highlight of the movie is the crisp animation and art style. Every movement feels right, each swing has weight, and each swing from web to web is more and more satisfying. The art style although the same as the previous movie, is a complete breath of fresh air, and I expect many to try and recreate this art style, yet fail due to the lack of soul. The story keeps you captivated through the entire runtime, from beginning to end you never want to look away for fear of missing something huge. Not only is this a wonderful sequel, it acts just as good as a prequel for the third movie. Every actor that took part in this film knocked their roles out of the park, and thrived. Gwen's story is paired extremely well with Miles story, and the two going back and fourth really make each story shine in their own ways. The action shots combining the two stories, then the climax at the end where every Spider-Man is attempting to apprehend Miles for his cannon event, it really shows just how important each segment was building up to it, and establishes a connection with his father to the audience.",positive
946,"Honestly this movie was AMAZING, i cant even explain like i am lost for words. A big congrats to all of the makers of this movie cause they did a superb job i enjoy every single second of this it literally had me on the edge of my seat, I DIDNT THINK THIS COULD BEAT THE FIRST MOVIE BUT BOYYYY IT DID !!!! The ending was literally a masterpiece and had my heart racing omg i was literally shaking ðŸ˜­ AND THEN MILES BEING PROWLER IN THE OTHER UNIVERSE??!??!!??!! BROOOOOO.. im so excited for the next one if it's as good as this and the last one then it's gonna be one of the best trilogy's ever! Ive rewatched it 4 times already at home trying to under every detail ðŸ’€",positive
947,"First act wows with action, visuals, sound and storytelling. Second act throws a lot of Spider people for us to enjoy. But it's there where story starts to look like writers are apologizing to their children for being terrible parents. And during entirety of third act I couldn't shake the feeling that cliff-hanger is coming and it did come in a most disappointing and least imaginative ways possible.If you're hyped about Miles, it's probably 11 out of 10. If you love dramas of magical people, it's probably 10 out of 10.If you wanted generally a great movie from start to finish, that's half there. Visually it's great, music is great holds to the last minute. But writing takes a dive after first half in a rather dramatic manner(pun intended) to reheat old jokes and known dramas.Ultimately it's a beautifully looking and sounding half-movie which starts a lot of plots, but is so gutted compared to first one that it ends only itself.But look, more Spider people suffering and being funny and doing action and playing out the same stories we know for 60 years, but AT THE SAME TIME.I mean wow, a masterpiece. And there's that BWAAAAH sound in the movie so you know you should be serious about it. 10/10 is not enough, we need to invent a new scale, like out of 30 and give it generous 15 points.",positive
948,"This movie was amazing ! It was a nice breathe of fresh air compared to other superhero movies too. It was most definitely worth the wait and as a neurodivergent person this has made me so unbelievably happy that I was able to see this in theaters ! I loved all the Spider people and everyone was absolutely amazing at their roles and the performance was astonishing ! I even loved how they added cursing to make it more realistic. This movie was the best thing I've seen for years. Watching this movie was amazing , I cannot wait for the next one to come out. I just know that the next movie will be great.",positive
949,"The animation the story and the characters are a 10/10 it shows the effort and love the animators put into this movie and I absolutely loved it!!!!It starts with a chilly and funny ambience but as it progress you start to feel the dark and crude side of spider man it also shows how losing people affects on how you change through the years, Miles is a character who loves too much, that is his weakness but also his biggest strength, I loved the diversity and inclusion from the characters and I also loved the antagonist Miguel and the villain The spot each one with a very different story but interesting I'm their own ways I love the movie is truly a masterpiece.",positive
950,"Oh my god this movie is basically perfect, a cliff hanger that leaves you on the edge of your seat, spectacular characters (Gwen, Hobie and Miles are all amazing) and such a good plot.The story doesn't really have a villain as both of the sides have a good point. On one side there is a 15 year old child wanting to save his father from dying, on the other there is a buff as Spider-Man trying to stop him because the multiverse will collapse if miles succeeds.Spider-Punk is by far the best character with an amazing suit and a brilliant personality as he roots for miles in and out, helping him along the way without really doing anything.This movie is top 2 for me along with, The Dark Knight. They are quite different but both outstanding. I'd never thought I'd say this about an animation.",positive
951,"No rave review here, not in the same league like The Dark Knight or Empire Strikes Back or Captain America: Winter Soldier.Don't get me wrong, it is good, actually quite good, but not the masterpiece it is made out to be by others. The visuals are mesmerizing, the sounds punchy and it has some nice character depth. But in the end it is a slowly paced story, stretched or spread too thin. Miles Morales is less likable than Into the Spider-Verse and is easily upstaged by almost every other character. And the villain disappears after the first act?This animation takes itself too seriously 8/10.",positive
952,"This is a fantastic movie! Love the animation as always, the voice actors are great, the plot is fascinating, the worst part is the cliffhanger at the end. I'm ready for part two. As long as one can get past the inherent silliness of a ""Spider-Verse,"" this movie is fairly serious and is very entertaining. It leaves the viewer wanting more and on the edge of his seat. My only mistake was not watching this sooner. This is a good sequel as well, following up on the last movie's character development and arches. This movie understands what Spider-Man is, and gives the fans what we want, without sacrificing quality.",positive
953,"In 2018, I was genuinely surprised by how great ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" was. I've seen plenty of superhero films and have sometimes been pretty entertained by them, but there are relatively few films in the genre that I would consider great. Fresh, fun, compelling and visually stunning, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" felt like a unique breath of fresh air from increasingly/more generic and fan service-y comic book films. Its unique style, character development, and soundtrack also helped contribute to its quality and memorability. The sequel, ""Across the Spider-Verse,"" is almost as great as the first. While its story is a bit more convoluted, the film otherwise is as strong as its predecessor in just about every other aspectThe film continues the story of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy through the multiverse, while introducing a new major villain, Spot. The storytelling and depictions of the multiverse are more unique than other superhero films, and the animation style is just as great as the first film. The fast-paced style of the animation and unique aesthetic changes between universes are commendable, and create a unique visual fluency that complements the film in a unique and encompassing way. Outstanding editing helps provide an engaging ebb and flow to all of these changes and the fast pace of the storytelling, animation, and action, making them all gripping and thrilling without being dizzying. The film's character development is better than most superhero movies, with Miles, his parents, Gwen, the Spider-Verse version of Peter Parker, and Miguel O'Hara all being uniquely developed and complemented by engaging dialogue that manages to comment on superhero fandom in a clever and surprisingly subversive way. The animated action sequences are fast-paced and kinetic, and effectively make use of the uniqueness of the animated style as a medium in ways distinct from a live-action superhero film. I will not say anything more about the twists and turns taken by the narrative, but suffice it to say the film certainly sets things up for the next installment, which is due out next year. I can confidently say that it will continue this series' tradition of great quality and should be well worth the wait. 8/10Note: I saw the film in ""The Big Show,"" Alamo Drafthouse's premium large format screen. The picture quality and Dolby Atmos sound quality were both outstanding and one of the best Big Show presentations to date. They greatly enhanced the animation and score, respectively.",positive
954,"I have seen many reviews on this movie ðŸŽ¬ with the most well descriptive words and thoughts on it and they still don't reach the standard of this movie in its entirety (actually they do, so to not belittle anyone's descriptions) it is without a fault now in its own class ......it was extraordinary.I have seen many reviews on this movie ðŸŽ¬ with the most well descriptive words and thoughts on it and they still don't reach the standard of this movie in its entirety (actually they do, so to not belittle anyone's descriptions) it is without a fault now in its own class ......it was extraordinary.I have seen many reviews on this movie ðŸŽ¬ with the most well descriptive words and thoughts on it and they still don't reach the standard of this movie in its entirety (actually they do, so to not belittle anyone's descriptions) it is without a fault now in its own class ......it was extraordinary.",neutral
955,"A very overrated cartoon, just like the first part! I don't understand where so many good ratings come from? Or is it all hype and fashion trends? There are much better cartoons than this! Even the first part was better than this cartoon. I don't see anything good here: the graphics are very bad, making my eyes hurt; the plot is quite monotonous and boring; There is no musical accompaniment, there is not a single memorable track. In the first part there was at least some soul, but here there is nothing! I hope people will reconsider their attitude towards this project, but in general there are much better films and cartoons about Spider-Man. This is my opinion, and many will agree with it!",negative
956,"I went and saw Oppenheimer the other day and thought to myself that this is one of the best movies in a long time! But today I saw a movie that kicked it's butt. This is by far one of THE best movies I have seen. Don't even hesitate to watch this movie, see it and enjoy the ride, because it is a wild ride! And this coming from a person not really liking this kind of animation from the beginning. But having watched the first movie I of course wanted to see this, and man, am I glad I did that. I will enjoy watching this more times for sure. All other Spider-Man movies will have to stand in the shadow because the best Spider-Man is animated.",positive
957,"I had a few minor issues with the first one where a few things were going a bit too obvious without giving scenes enough time to properly deeply connect with the characters, which is only an issue because the film would've been so perfect if that was also taken care of a tiny bit better. That's what I noticed the most in this film, you are properly invested in these characters. And that can't be completely attributed to the previous movie, they did a pretty great job in establishing that here itself.What they did wonderfully but totally expected was the great blending of different art styles and the absolutely amazing animation that resulted from it throughout the movie. A lot of cameos and easter eggs that feels pretty earned and not just throwaway stuff. Concepts of multiversal interference or whatever you can call it executed brilliantly by focusing on the imminent and personal problems, thus making it much more compelling than every attempt at it by MCU. And the music is beautiful and perfectly fit for each moment in the film.Some of the action setpieces are so amazing, it proves that the best way to portray incredible comic-book action is still animation and here they can do it without the limitations of comic books too.I can't reiterate how happy I am to see scenes lingering at the right moments for them to capture and let the viewers immerse in the emotions of it which is getting less and less common in Hollywood. But like a couple of films from Malayalam and Tamil recently where I enjoyed this aspect, here also the movie ends up being just a half. The only problem with this movie is that it ends with a cliffhanger which feels like an interval punch moment in Indian movies. But I'm not angry with it. I'm all for creators taking their time to develop the story at their proper pace and if they have to make multiple movies for it, we should consider it a bonus.",positive
958,"This is a good sequel, fulfills, entertains, amazes, excites. But it also overwhelms and saturates a viewer who is not prepared for what they are going to see in 140 minutes. The visual style and the animation concepts have been reinterpreted from the first film. I don't think there's an improvement, because I'm just seeing a reshuffling of what's on offer in Into the Spider-Verse, which, to be honest, is pretty hard to top something that redefined the genre so recently. So in that light, this sequel maintains its great visual quality. The new samples are masterfully displayed, being a delight to look at. The kinetic flow of the characters is at times impressive, as it is resonant with a reality outside of animation.Generally speaking, the movie is very entertaining, it has a lot of comedy, a lot of action at a hectic pace, many emotions, it has thousands of new characters and with this many references to them in all the media in which they have appeared. One thing this movie does very well is give its villains adequate screen time, giving each one good development and avoiding the mistakes that Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 have made in the past. That being said, this is also an ambitious film that can become a bit heavy due to the large amount of information and characters.Now, my problems begin in the plot. The sequences that recall the stories of the original film are redundant, as they steal precious minutes of footage from the new story. Then, when we start to see part of the new plot, it feels repetitive, as it's something that has already been seen in some recent MCU products, and although it was hinted that Sony's Spider Universe (or whatever it's called) is now canon, it seems to me that the initial proposal for Across the Spider-Verse lacks a bit of originality. That being said, the development of that same plot is where the best of the film can be found, because we're going down a path that has the complexity that the first film didn't have.Another detail that could overshadow the film is only for fans of the MCU. There are contradictions, rather than complementary explanations, to the last great saga in development, specifically with the Loki series. The coupling between the big producers that have the rights of Spider-Man is very noticeable, but it's also noticeable that they want to follow their own path. This must be corrected as soon as possible, so as not to ruin The Multiverse Saga, which can be better than The Infinite Saga if these errors are pointed out and corrected.In summary, great movie, which could be part of the best of the year, but in my opinion, it does not manage to surpass Into the Spider-Verse.Recommended for fans of comics and the different arts that the cinema gives us from time to time.",positive
959,"Once again like with the original there is amazing and innovating animation every detail is beautifully made and they suit the characters perfectly. The character development in this movie is amazing everyone had a time to shine and they really dove deep into Gwen and also Miles' parents we got to know these characters and their feelings a lot better the relationship between Gwen and her father is explained and we understand Gwen's background story a lot better so we sympathize with her struggle it is clearly portrayed how the role of Spider-Man can be a burden and take a toll on their personal lives and responsibilities, can't wait to see the third one.",positive
960,"Honestly I expected it to be good but not this good this movie is in my opinion the greatest animated movie of all time the animation was perfect the story telling was perfect the build up of the villain perfect the plot twist perfect the only thing that I don't like is that I have to wait another year for part two.The rest of this is a chat gpt summary of miles morales.Miles Morales, also known as Spider-Man, is a beloved Marvel character. As a Afro-Latino teenager, he brings a fresh perspective to the iconic superhero role. With his unique powers and electric venom blasts, Miles swings through the streets of New York, fighting crime and balancing his dual identities. He embodies resilience, courage, and the power of diversity in the world of superheroes. Miles Morales has captured the hearts of fans worldwide with his relatable personality and inspiring journey.",positive
961,The animation style was taken to the next level and the story was crazy they took this movie to the next level having some hilarious jokes and amazing action scenes leaving a very insane cliff hanger delivering such an incredible performances and outstanding character building. The characters were amazing and the chase scenes the story line was very detailed and they planned out the story perfectly with the crazy fight scenes and extremely artistic and creative animation. You also felt emotion as you were watching the movie because it cause you to understand how they felt and how they were super stressed of living to lives.,positive
962,"I freaking loved this movie, but... let me start by saying this was a feast for the eyes; maybe too much so. There was a lot going on on screen since the movie opens. Glitching and flashing it gave my wife and I headaches. And now that I got the negative out of the way, the story is great. It has the heart of the original movie while setting up for more character growth. Honestly it's the character driven story that has me sold on the spiderverse universe. I love thier individual stuggles and aspirations. It's such a well written story, even the villain, who didn't have much on screen time felt well written enough to where you always felt his presence. Despite hundreds of characters on screen at a time it never loses its focus. An absolute fun time despite the visual overload. Can not wait for the final part.",positive
963,"I really like the animation style, particularly how it changed between the universes; the soundtrack was also really good. However, i wasn't a fan of much else. The jokes Myles made were clearly directed to 11-12 years olds. I'm sure I enjoyed the jokes to the first movie when I was a bit younger but at my current age I just found them a bit stupid to be honest. There was very little combat. His fight with the hole guy was not a proper fight in my opinion and apart from that there was literally no fighting. The only other decent bit was when Miguel slams him into the floor/wall but the scene looked better in the trailer to be honest.",positive
964,"Wow. Simply wow. What an incredible feat of storytelling and art. Somehow this film has improved upon pretty much every element of its predecessor and I am blown away. I'd like to give everyone who worked on this masterpiece a gentle and consensual kiss on the forehead. The visuals were sublime, jam packed with not just eye candy, but deep symbolism, just a treat. The music was just as stylish as the first, writing was fantastic. Every character felt so alive and relatable, all with believable and understandable motives that make them so easy to feel for, making for a fantastic multifaceted story with so much to unpack. What a beautiful beautiful movie, looking forward to seeing it in theatres a third time.",positive
965,"Yes is not the greast movie off al time but yeah is greatest movie animated that i ever seen this movie has a good soundtrack we all agreed in that has a good graphics has a great storie a fantastic plot twist has miguel o'hara a great antagonist and this is a film that when you are watching you need to think and realize what is happening you know why?

966,"Spider man Across the Spider Verse, the animated sequel to the academy award winning, Spider Man Into The Spider Verse is not only one of the greatest sequels ever made, but quite possibly one of the greatest animated films ever released.Building on the stretch of the original film, it picks up right after the events of the first film. Spider Man Miles Morales, and Spider girl Gwen Stacy continue their adventures into the spider verse, this time with a brand new villain, The Spot who is far more formidable than the first film's villain.the Kingpin.What was teased in the original film opens up with literally thousands of Spider Man from hundreds of different universes, hence the Spider Verse,Some of the best animations, story telling and awesome characters add up to a new level of comic book entertainment.This is easily the best film of 2023 so far, Don't Miss IIt!",positive
967,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts.Great to Incredible Direction (Really brings a unique flair to telling story as it takes elements from the previous movie while also adding more mature tones to show a more holistic representation of the Spider-Verse and their characters; Gets a lot more out of the voice actors this time around; creates an even more grand opus of a universe as the fighting and animation are used in conjunction to create such captivating images (building off an already brilliant animation style); the attention to detail in the micro scenes were also nice to see), Good to Very Good Voice Acting (Good from Shameik Moore (Has a very similar performance as the first one, embodies the role of a young Spider-Man navigating different pressures in life), Very Good from Hailee Steinfeld (Builds off the last performance very well as she shows more dimensions to the character and really steals the scenes she is in), Very Good from Brian Tyree Henry (Continues to give a multi-dimensional vocal performance here as he shows the angry and loving side of being a father; also does a good job in playing the comedic relief in the scenes he is in), Very Good from Luna Lauren VÃ©lez (The biggest improvement from the previous film as she shows so many emotions to display a caring mother who really wants what is best for her son (even if that means letting him go)), Good to Very Good from Jake Johnson (Shows a bit more range this time around as the element of being a father allows him to be more empathetic to Miles), Good from Jason Schwartzman (Not too much a menacing villian but does a good job in the scenes he is in), Good to Very Good from Issa Rae (The force she is in the movie is really displayed through this vocal performance as we how important she is to the Spider-Force), Good to Very Good from Karan Soni (Really embodies an Indian Spider-Man very well), Very Good from Daniel Kaluuya (Steals the scenes he is in as he has somewhat of a loving tension between him and Miles, Kaluuya also seems like he is just pooling from his experience being a British actor), Very Good to Great from Oscar Isaac (The real menacing force of the movie and the true foil for Miles, steals the scenes he is in by showing why he does what he does), Good from the rest of the cast), Incredible Story (Really builds from the last movie as they steer away from the template that made the last movie predictable and showed more about Mile's importance in the Spider-Verse; the darker elements of the movie were also great to see included as it shows both the good and the bad of being a Spider-Man (especially about the parallelism in timelines); there are many iconic elements of the story that will eventually be told in pop-culture (like Canon events)), Incredible Screenplay (The dialogue this time was more powerful and profound in its meaning as it really touched on the ideas of purpose and growing up; Jokes not as funny this time (which is kinda byproduct of it being more of a serious movie); The symbolism really improves this time around as it is way more evident and really helps in showing the meaning/message of the movie (also the easter eggs were also really nice to see as they help tie the worlds together/are nice things to see); the foreshadowing was an integral part of the movie as it helped show the parallelism between the different worlds and how some events were predictable (also the small details act as important elements for how the story unfolds later on in the movie)), Incredible Score (Builds on an already great score form the first movie as it keeps all the good themes from the first movie while adding new genres to shows the personalities of all the different characters; used very well to help build suspense (especially during the beginning and end with Gwen))/Good Soundtrack (was fine but just not as many hits as the first movie), Great Sound (especially during the fight scenes), Incredible to Brilliant Editing (Really build on the last movie as it brought all the worlds together while still keeping that comic book feel as the first movie; the editing strengths were shown very well in the fighting scenes as it helps bring together all this small elements in the macro sized scenes), Brilliant Visual Effects/Animation (Builds off the revolutionary 2D animation style they used in the first movie as they use different animation styles to help give character to the different worlds (with the Gwen world being the most visually appealing through the use of colors); again is used well to help tell the story with the different visual text elements; the animation of the fighting scenes were also stunning as they really showed their full capability in making such beautiful worlds), Plot Structure was kinda the biggest fault of this movie just because of the nature of the movie (the movie is one of two parts so its a constant build to a cliffhanger), Pacing was a bit on the slower side (though a better pace than the last movie) as it seems the directors wanted to use the fact that this movie is one of two parts to help build the scenes well without being too fast; Runtime was fine (given this movie is one of two parts, I feel like they used the runtime well to build everything up to a point where you are leaving wanting more), Climax was incredible as it was incredibly suspenseful and shows some of the hidden messages of the movie; the movie leaves off in the middle of the climax (creating this cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more), Tone was a bit more darker this time (though the beginning is pretty similar to the first movie) as it helps show how Miles has to prove himself in the universe and how he needs to navigate the pressures of being Spider-Man while also growing up, The Indian representation of this movie was a Chef's kiss as it was nice to finally see the largest populated country in the world portrayed in one of the franchises in Pop-Culture (and in a good way as well)",positive

969,"This movie was the single best Spider-Man film ever created. The animation, the acting, the story and the writing could not be better. I will definitely be re-watching this movie many times over. All I can do is thank Sony for bringing us this masterpiece of a film. The animation quality is groundbreaking and every second could be framed and put on a wall. I could watch the move at half speed and have as much of not more fun than the fist time around. There were scenes that looked like they were ripped straight from a comic book. The random funny text bubbles were amazing and incredibly funny. 11/10 would recommend and rewatch.",positive
970,"The best film in the Spider-Man Franchise. And probably my favourite film of all time, with that said let me explain why and how this is a Fantastic film, without Spoilers .First of the animation, it is absolutely remarkable. I've never seen animation like this, and in a good way. It's gorgeous. So many colours sets the tone and a comic book adaptation brilliantly. There's no faults to it. The colour and the special effects team have pulled out top tier animation. The style is better in this then it is in the first film.The story,The story is well paced, with some clever action set pieces. The Spider-Man flick has some of the best action sequences in the franchise, in my opinion. The world building and the characters are well established, and the Marvel crew do a pretty good job of that in this film. The set designs is a colourful delight. Glorious just looking at it. The design of Miles Mirallas is new costume is wonderful, not just colourful but also brings a comic book feel to it.The film has lots of emotional beats and connects it to the characters well. Who are all charming and likable characters in there own unique way. With some touches of the mutiverse in this moving picture, of brilliance.The Jokes work well in this film, and I think it's because they do it in clever ways. As well as the Villain, who is well animated and character. Charming and likeable. With the action and the Villain the Jokes will crack you up. Down right Hillarious film.Everything about this film is truly amazing, the character depth and the style is something else.Verdict,Flawless,10/ðŸ”Ÿ",positive
971,"This is a perfect example of how far a human imagination can reach. AI cant beat that for sure. If you think you have seen enough of multiverse in Doctor strange and Spider-man: No way home than wait wait.. you are about to get mind bogglingly crazy. From start to end this thing is a masterpiece. Also, Indian spiderman truly made my day. An animated movie simply can't get better than this. Waiting to see 'Mumbatta' again in the next chapter. Do watch this movie only in theatres as it required a lot of concentration and don't wait for the OTT release. I was about to give an standing ovation at the end but saved it for the next sequel.",positive
972,"This is honestly the BEST movie I've ever seen and I think one of the best movies ever made! The story kept me with my eyes glued on the screen, literally had me on the edge of my seat and biting my nails. The characters relationships with each other are so inspiring that it makes you wanna se more about them. And don't even get me started on the animation! You can clearly see why it took 5 years to make this movie, it felt like I was transported into the movie!! Everything is perfectly executed! Just know that if you're really emotional like me, you might wanna bring a tissue or two to the theater lol.",positive
973,"The animation quality is one of the first things about the new Miles Morales Spider-Man movie that will draw you in. The story is just as excellent, delivering an emotion-packed plotline with stunning action and multi-versal layering.I found all this, and then some, in ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" - the much-awaited sequel to the 2018 movie ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"".A star-studded voice cast further enriched the story and made it exponentially more entertaining. Other voice artists too did great work in ""Across the Spider-Verse"". Special shoutout to Shameik Moore (as Miles Morales) and Hailee Steinfeld (as Gwen Stacy).The story goes back into the insane multiverse, and this time it brought together even more 'Spider-People', particularly those who'd been tasked with safeguarding the multiverse itself. What Miles did in ""Into the Spider-Verse"" had destabilized the multiverse, the consequences of which were expertly explored in ""Across the Spider-Verse"".The big-bad (in a way) villain in this story was the surprising, intimidating, and unforgettable Miguel O'Hara, aka Spider-Man 2099. He was voiced by the inimitable Oscar Isaac who gave the character outstanding gravitas. Miguel was, in fact, part of the task force I mentioned earlier. He made a perfect case for a good guy gone bad.I especially loved how they made his motives feel empathic and self-accountable. That's not easy to do, more so when you factor in Miguel's vampire-ninja traits. His overall characterization made me feel for his pain but also feel afraid at what he might do to Miles. Miguel O'Hara thus ended up redefining the phrase ""you've got to be cruel to be kind"".Other villains were also 'crossing over' and adding to the multiversal madness. These included Vulture (voiced by Jorma Taccone) and Spot (voiced by Jason Schwartzman). The latter was the actual villain in the story.The Alchemax 42 (i.e., Earth-42) spider - the one that originally bit Miles Morales - was the creation of Dr. Jonathan Ohnn, aka The Spot. An accident around that time resulted in Miles unwittingly 'creating' Spot. And it was Spot who later manipulated the multi-verse (in this movie) to establish a new brand of trans-dimensional chaos.All these wonderfully interconnected elements created captivating layers of cause-and-effect meaning around the events that made Miles the 'new' Spider-Man.The team also explored a romance angle between Miles and Gwen, giving it a realistic and rooted flourish, which I genuinely appreciated. Despite them being animated characters, it wasn't hard to relate to much of what these two were going through. That's exceptional writing and even better animation, right there.The empowerment angle was also on point. The team invested equal importance in, and gave equivalent independence to, both Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy.Now, since I'm from India, I couldn't help but be drawn to the lush futuristic visuals they lent the city of Mumbai, or should I say 'Mumbattan'. Everything about Pavitr Prabhakar, the Indian Spider-Man (voiced by Karan Soni), felt inspiring, cultural, stylish, and cool.They did something similar with New York, or rather Nueva York (in Earth-928). Those designs too was stunning, to say the least. This location also housed 'Spider Society' which, in keeping with its name, gave me a remarkable peek into nearly all the Spider-People from various multi-verses. 'Fan-tastic' would be the ideal word for what I saw in these sequences.From concepts like messing with 'canon events' to artistic comic-book style animation and an unwavering dedication to pace and detail, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" became a web of winners. See what I did there? A multi-Spidey joke? Moving on...
The movie's final reveal was unnerving, in a good way. It featured an alternate timeline where our Miles Morales discovered his Uncle Aaron was still alive and that he was working with that timeline's Miles, who was in truth the villain known as the Prowler.Meanwhile, Spot played his trump card which promised the coming of ominous events capable of destroying everything Miles loved and cherished. These and other major moments in ""Across the Spider-Verse"" set powerful precedents for the third Miles Morales movie, and it can't get here soon enough.",positive
974,"Just like its predecessor, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute masterpiece and revolutionizes what an animated movie can be. The biggest standout is its absolutely breathtaking yet somehow seamless blending of a wide variety of animation and filmmaking styles. So many frames of this film are truly jaw-dropping (particularly the scenes involving Gwen and The Spot, which look like they came from an art museum at points), but the film isn't just a pretty face. The wide cast of characters, both new and from the previous films, are a delight to follow, with Miles, Gwen, and Spider-Punk being the true standouts, with their respective voice actors doing a great job as well. The story and humor are equally as strong as the first film, but this film further explores what it means to be Spider-Man and how we find our place in a complex, messy world. Furthermore, Daniel Pemberton's score is absolutely phenomenal again and Metro Boomin's original music is a welcome addition as well. I truly cannot praise this film enough and everyone involved, from the directors and writers to the animators and story boarders. We need more of this in both animation and Hollywood in general, and I truly cannot wait til Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out next year. This is a must watch and, once again, transforms the entire genre of superhero movies and the medium of animation...AGAIN.",positive
975,"I feel like I've been missing something here, don't get me wrong the film is good but the way it's been hyped I kind of went in thinking it would be some sort of cinematic masterpiece. My hopes were high for this film seeing how well it has been received and the 8.5+ rating it has on imdb but although I enjoyed it I feel a bit underwhelmed. It's kind of what I felt for the first film. It's decent but not amazing. It's been a bit too overhyped in my opinion. I also don't like how long the second film was compared to the first one just for all of it too end up in a cliffhanger. But overall it's a good film that I would recommend.",positive
976,"Somehow even more gorgeous than the first, with a story that resonates just as much, if slightly off pace-which became apparent at the end, when it said to be continued. I'll happily watch another one and am glad there's a lot more to come, as it did feel like a lot needed to be addressed yet. Loved the core of the story, and how Gwen played a bigger role.I actually have the original spider-Gwen run and the into the spiderverse event, so it was very cool to see their take on that comic run, which probably isn't even a decade old yet. It's wild seeing something new transition to the big screen with a similar aesthetic. Incredible stuff.",positive
977,"It's impossible to explain how good this movie really is. To grasp its greatness, go to the movie and watch it. It's shockingly great, even more so than the first one which I loved. The main cast is great, including spot and especially spiderpunk. The movie is paced so well and flows through the story in a way that keeps you glued to the screen. Also the ending is great and sets up part 2 phenomenally. The whole plot goes from objective to objective in a way that introduces all the characters very well, so even though the cast in huge, it really doesn't seem that way. Seriously, words can't explain how amazing this movie is. Seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen. Can't wait for more!",positive
978,I had no problems in theaters and it was animated really great. I honestly think it is a perfect sequel but the cliffhanger made me kind of sad. I am really exited for the sequel coming in 2024 and i would love to watch it again in theaters. The movie was predictable at times but not in a bad way.

979,"When I first stepped into the theater, I was expecting the type of sequel that would be overhyped and only hold a mostly messy storyline with strange and out of place characters to its name. I was very wrong. When you watch this movie, you see the effort and passion of every person that has crafted this film, from the music scores to the visual effects to the exciting fast paced action scenes. It really brings a fresh new type of feel to a very long franchise, and adds elements to the first movie that make you hunger for more of this special feeling. Exciting rush of adrenaline and genuine emotion in a strange multiverse of struggle among every Spider-Man and every dimension. Thanks for putting this together, Sony.",neutral
980,"I am an immense fan of the Spider-Verse movie trilogy. I was blown away by the first movie as it set the standard for what a top of the line film should be. Naturally, the second film not only met those high level expectations but surpassed them by great margins.To keep the review simple, the outstanding animation style exclusive to Spider-Verse alone pairs perfectly with the incredibly intense plot. The concept of the Multi-Verse is always tricky to capture in condensed movie time frames. Yet Spider-Verse has mastered this tact, to somehow go over the endless concepts of what Spider man has to offer. Exciting, Riveting, Funny, action packed, it has it all.This is just one of those movies I am happy I had the honor to watch in theaters.",positive
981,"An amazing story told with amazing characters focusing on grounded relationships explored through the multiverse. Spider Man Across the spider verse proves that giving your characters room, giving them a story to tell and taking your time to tell it, is a winning formula. The story is a 9/10, the only downside is the ending, or lack off. I always believed story's should be told in full, specially when you're paying a movie ticket to see it. This does not mean sequels are not allowed, but that if you're telling a story in a movie that fits into a larger universe, that you should finish with the story of the movie even if the story of the larger universe remains unfinished. However, giving the quality of the story, the quality of the animation and the quality of the characters, then I'm willing to give it a pass on the ""to be continued"" ending.I just want to emphasize on quality of the animation, when Pixar has defined the gender, then this movie goes in a completely different direction in terms of style, tone, colors and more. It just feels alive.I just love when a movie takes risks, this animation is just a proof of that. They took a huge gamble (also on the prequel) on trying a ""new"" animation style, and it completely pays off. I can't wait for the sequel.",positive
982,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an absolute triumph in the world of animated cinema, solidifying its place as a modern masterpiece.

Simply put, it is a cinematic masterpiece for the ages.",positive
983,"Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse is a top tier Spider-Man film. It may as well be the best Spider-Man 2 film. I like to compliment the animators. The animation is great. The animators sure made each universe is unique and different from each other.This movie brings up the theme fate vs free will. It begs the question ""Will you save the people who you truly love if you know they'll die in this specific way at this specific time even if it might destroy all of reality?"" Miles definitely says yes and Spider-Man 2099 says no. That question will definitely will be explored more in Beyond the Spider-Verse.This movie was originally titled Spider-Man Beyond the Spider-Verse Part 1, so expect when Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out, these two movies feel like one movie split into two. This movie does try to help explain why we see similar things played out in previous Spider-Man movies and possibly future ones. This movie does explain why I find Spider-Man such a good character. I find this movie pretty rewatchable and can't wait until Beyond the Spider-Verse comes out.",positive
984,"Where do I begin, this movie had a very high risk of disappointing. With how loved and good the first Spider-Man into the spider verse movie was. However this movie exceeded my expectations, especially with the antagonists.They correctly turned a un-intimidating joke villain into a menacing multiversal threat. You can really feel for the guy too with his problems of not being taken serious and his emptiness which had been filled with rage for Miles. And Spider-Man 2099 was just as good, when we viewers first see him we really like him. He is your typical cool dark hero. However he later becomes a major threat to our protagonists which gave the audience a new set of unfamiliar feelings towards him. His backstory really allowed the viewers to feel for him and it later explained his dedication to stopping Miles from saving his father. This had the viewers twisted up on whose side to take. The villains of this movie were just expertly pulled off.I also liked how they reintroduced the original Spider-Man obstacles. They give Miles a lot of human problems that all of us deal with which can help the audience relate to him, like time management and girl problems and many more complications. They even threw in a peek into Gwen's problems and feelings like issues with her Dad and dealing with others.The cliff hanger is what everyone was talking about. I feel like it's good for the sake of making the second sequence of the movie as high quality as possible and I don't know how I would have felt if the movie was 4 hours long so I'm glad they split it up. They also left it off at a good time that left the viewers with questions to make them excited for the new movie.Overall this movie was close to flawless, amazing animation and cinematography which everyone can enjoy. 10/10.",positive
985,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: Well, just left the theater for Spider-Man Across the spider verse and wow! I'm speechless. Always been a fan of into the spider verse and this film expanded upon everything the first spider verse film setup and more. You laugh, you cry and above all you smile. I don't think I smiled more in a movie. And the animation style somehow outdid into the spider verse's. Which I didn't even think was possible. Something about this film that is gonna but a lot of people however is the massive cliffhanger ending, however it just gives me more time to build up hype for beyond the spider verse. Anyways I love this movie, and go see it!",positive
986,"I had tried to stay away from trailers to avoid as much as I can and wow, I am blown away.The story is good, it's a follow up to the previous where Miles is still struggling to balance the spider life and being a kid, he is missing his multiverse friends and especially Gwen. The movie really gets going when a new villain called spot who can travel through holes to anywhere is demolished by miles and insulted. He plans to grow his powers, creating the ability to multiverse travel. The story goes on and it's hard to say as it continues after spoilers but things MUST happen but Miles can't accept it.The animation was AMAZING, it goes along with a pitch perfect score, there was once or twice the voices were quite low behind the music but that could have been the cinema.Obviously it's around Miles but this movie is equally Gwens movie, she has gone through and is going through a lot. The supporting characters were all great and this movie is genuinely funny.This is not a spoiler but the movie ends on a cliffhanger and the third movie is scheduled for next year. This doesn't take away from the movie, it leaves me wanting more in a good way.",positive
987,"Let me just start by saying wow, this movie is insane. Not only does it have some of the best animation in a movie and it takes the already great animation from the first one and somehow makes it even better. The story is where it's at. I know that most sequels aren't as good as the original, but this movie was Awesome with a capital A and blew the original out of the water. The story was phenomenal and I can't believe how everything tied in together perfectly like a web. The villains were also great, I think spot is a great villain, he's funny and comedic, but also intimidating and you kinda feel bad about him. I'm super excited to see what happens next and hopefully it will slap like this movie did. Great job sonny and good like with beyond the spider verse.",positive
988,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing movie that I absolutely loved! And let me tell you, it surpassed all my expectations. From the incredible visuals to the heartfelt story, this movie had me hooked from beginning to end.The animation is stunning. The colors are bright, the art styles are cool, and the action scenes are really exciting. It feels like you're watching a comic book come to life, and it's so cool to see. The attention to detail is really impressive, and every part of the movie looks incredible.But it's not just the way it looks that's great - the story is fantastic too. It follows the journey of Miles Morales, who is a more confident hero this time around. The movie has a good mix of funny moments, emotional parts, and thrilling action. It all comes together to tell a really interesting and engaging story. Plus, they introduce new characters that make the Spider-Verse even more interesting.The music in the movie is also really good. The songs they chose fit perfectly with what's happening on the screen. It makes the movie even more exciting and helps you feel more involved in the action.For us, the Indian Spider-Man called Pavitra Prabhakar (Karan Soni) who has little to do but give a short tour of Bombay.This movie may primarily target a younger audience, but I found the story to be fast-paced and quite complex. As a result, I believe it might pose a challenge for kids to fully comprehend and follow along.(Note-It's my first review on this site.)",positive
989,"Best movie...the best movie i seen in my entire life...its exicting, beautiful, have sad scenes...and more more. That 13 seconds silence when Miles says to his mom ""i'm spiderman."" *13 seconds silence* ""whos spiderman?"" This was a fake ending. And I literally screamed when Miles was gliching, while he tought he was in the wrong universe. The whole cinema screamed when Gwen Said ""He's in the wrong universe"". And when Uncle Aaron showed up... crazy...the scene where it shows that in that universe, Miles's dad died, I started crying. It was so sad, and crazy. And the scene when it. Turns out that Miles is Prowler in that universe...I was so into it that I left the cinema with trembling legs. Waiting for the next movie...",positive
990,"This movie is thrilling, amazing, gonna make you cry, laugh, get you on a roller coaster, make you feel good. I was not too happy about the secret ending that it's gonna end on a cliff note... But apart from that, holy F I can't get enough of watching this movie. Especially if you loved the first one. From the start they grip you in and you're done. You can't stop watching it. Every time I watch this, I just can't wait to see how it what happens in the next part. I hope they bring it out ASAP.CAN YOU BELIEVE, even after having so many spiderman characters from like million universes they always still able to have such an amazing character development for almost all of them. That's called good direction. Keep it up and don't let the strikes destroy this franchise, PLEASE!",positive
991,"I love this movie so much like SJSJKDKABDJD i honestly don't understand how anybody could hate it the plots so interesting and there's so many twists. AND THE CLIFFHANGER? OH MY GOSH. The whole movie my face was like ""üòß"" LOL- everything about this movie was AMAZING. The characters, the visuals, the soundtrack, EVERYTHINGGGG bro i walked out of that movie theater with a changed mind. The whole time i was in that seat i was gripping the arm rests because of how intense this movie was. Not to mention how many COOL CHARACTERS THERE ARE. LIKE OMG?? This movie did NOT disappoint. Anyways I love this movie so much, IM SO OBSESSED WITH IT LIKE PLEASE HELP OMG üò≠ anyways I can't wait for part 2 i'm so excited!!!!",positive
992,"Amazing animation but movie is prolonged...The movie is about two and a half hours long and you have to understand that it doesn't have a proper ending (no denouement). So for me, this movie is kinda prolonged.Maybe it is not for cinemas, it could be more comfortable to watch at home (from the first part, than this and then the last one), because you would have an opportunity to pause, think etc.So I have to say that this animation work is hard to perceive and analyze at the same time (in a really good way). The animation here is indescribable, it is so amazing, different, and various!!!",positive
993,"Watched the film last night and omg it was the best cinematic experience ever, great picture, comedy, action packed. And the best cliff hanger I've seen all my life. Definitely recommend if your a spider man fan. 10/10. Another reason why this is the best film going is because the casting is fantastic. With other characters who also came into this film late. I didn't think this film would be better than this first. But its better than no way home on my opinion. Another reason why I think this film is good is because even though the villan didn't have much screen time he did play his part very well.",positive

Oh my gosh! I was not disappointed! The movie was amazing! I'm really happy because Miles Morales is my favorite Spider-Man. I've read the comics, they're not bad. I've watched the first film, it's not bad. This was one of those rare events where the sequel is better than the first movie. Across The Spiderverse had me like: üòµüòÉüò¨üò≤ I wonder what happens in Beyond The Spiderverse? I'll have to wait until it premieres. This film proves that there are still great Marvel movies.

995,"Probably the best animated film I've ever seen, and unquestionably one of my favorite movies of the year. Like the first movie, the animation style is stunning - I love the vibrant color palette and the blend of hand-drawn elements with CGI. The visuals combined with Metro Boomin's soundtrack make for a euphoric viewing experience. This film is everything a sequel should be, by expanding the universe (or spiderverse in this case) while also delving deeper into the main character arcs. I was immersed in the story and wasn't ready for the movie to end when it did. The final installment of this trilogy can't come soon enough!",positive
996,I'm not the biggest fan of animated films or anime but this films is exactly what a comic book looks like put to screen. Now the film isn't just great for the visuals but man oh man this is one of the best visual experiences I've ever seen. The work that must of went into this is staggering. The most visual aspect being the backgrounds. It's amazing how the filmmakers put so much effort and talent towards making not just the characters but the backgrounds specifically are breathtaking.Now the film is more then just visuals. The story is very engaging and well written. These are great characters and a story that works on all levels. Like I said animated films don't really make me feel anything but for some reason this film made me care about the characters. Miles and his family drama is great but the Miles & Gwen storyline is handled so perfectly and I can't wait to see how their story ends.Needless to say this film is an improvement over the first. While not a perfect film it is very pleasing to look at and had me fully invested in the characters & Im actually excited to see the finale.,positive
997,"They've leaned so hard into the multi-verse cliche that nothing matters anymore. Who cares if someone dies? There are infinite Spider-Men! Strange new characters are introduced poorly. Maybe if I were deep into the comic lore it would make more sense, but I don't think one should need to read comics to appreciate a movie.The animation is very creative. The movie feels like one long dream sequence. Full of pretty colours, non-sensical situations, and bizarre non-sequiturs. It's like a moving comic book, which I suppose connects with my criticism above. This movie is made first and only for comic book lovers.",neutral
998,"Can't believe it's been 5 years since the first one. I *can* believe it's Miles from that 2018 Oscar-Winning first Spider-Verse film.Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse had me ALLL the way until the very last second. It would be criminal to spoil it, if it hasn't already been leaked online (or common knowledge I definitely missed.) ALL I could say as the credits rolled: WTH.That and its extreme length really made me drive down my rating - though 8/10 is still very good. (Just not the 9/10 I awarded the original.) Seriously. No animated movie, no matter how good, should be almost 2Â½ hours. In fact, combine this with #1 and you'd have a great trilogy instead. Not to mention, the original's 3-minutes shy of 2 hours, which was also flaw of that movie. What's the third one gonna be? 4 hours? (Thanks, John Wick.)But I digress. Much like the first one, this animation is, with NO EXAGGERATION: Perfection. Like breathtaking. With most animated movies, the first few seconds set the scene for the animation style you'll get for the remainder of the feature. So, those have to rely on story, characters, etc once the animation style is established and fades into the background. The Spider-Verse duo is fortunate enough to have GREAT animation in addition to great stories and characters.What starts off as Gwen (Spider-Woman) Stacy's movie - so much so, I thought it would've been awesome if they titled this sequel ""Spider-Woman's Turn in the Spider-Verse,"" it does become Miles (Spider-Man) Morales' movie, conflict and core storyline. That's not to take away from Gwen as she's key to all of this.Miles has the typical alter-ego Spider-Man troubles with family and villains and when his ""nemesis"" appears, he needs the help of his multi-Universe buddies to help right this new wrong. Oh, and there's so much more to this plot. So much more.Frankly, I'm getting sick of the multi-Universe trope in Marvel, MCU and now, I guess, DCEU (with The Flash coming soon.) I understand it's part of this series of Spider-Man films, but it was also part of the best MCU/Spider-Man film (""No Way Home."") AND it's now the main thread in the MCU. I just kinda wish this follow-up to the near-perfect 2018 Animated movie moved away from that.Still, it worked here and I didn't mind it so much. Since it's now 100% established to never go away in this particular set of Spider-Man movies, I'm okay with it. I just wish the other movies would just stop using it so much and move on.Sounds like I'm all negative here. My apologize as this IS a fantastic movie and follow-up with the same incredible imagination with the cinematography, careful/wonderful details, absolutely hilarious/smart script and really deep characters. I swear these animated ""people"" had waaay more emotion than I see in most life action films. THAT takes a TON of talent and heart. If this also wins Best Animated movie at the Oscars, I would not be upset about that.I had seen the original Spider-Verse film in theatres and only that one time overall, despite absolutely loving it. I had time today before part 2 so I searched online for it. Since the sequel was released this weekend, naturally they wouldn't have it available on any of the streaming platforms for free. So I bought it and rewatched it to refresh myself after a half-decade of not seeing it.Funny thing though: I actually didn't need to. This movie recapped that one for a good tenth of the screentime. While it is helpful to have seen the 1st one - and it's so good, there's no reason to miss it, you almost don't need to as they constantly bring you up to speed with almost every plot point from Into the Spider-Verse.Of course, I highly recommend this movie. You should see both, for sure. Just...that's well over 4 hours of your time. Plan accordingly.***Final Thoughts: Here's my ranking of all theatrically released Spider-Man movies from BEST to Trash:1.

999,"I briefly reviewed Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) in one of my posts soon after it was released in theaters, and it seems to me that some people got the idea that I don't like this film. This is not the case. I went to see this film 2 or 3 times when it was playing in theaters. I own it on video. I even have the soundtrack. It's just that I like Incredibles 2 (2018), which was released in the same year, slightly more than Into The Spider-Verse, and I don't think that Into The Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man movie or the best superhero movie ever. I think that Spider-Man 2 (2004) is still the best Spider-Man movie ever. I would say that both Into The Spider-Verse and Incredibles 2 have replay value. This is something that I can't say about many films that got made in the last two or even three decades. When I watched Into The Spider-Verse for the first time, I felt that something is not quite right with it, although I already realized that it's a special film. Into The Spider-Verse features a number of inspired scenes, appealing and detailed animation, a rather epic story, some good characterization, and many neat details. Still, perhaps the only main character that appealed to me back then is Peter B. Parker because I could relate to this character in a few ways and because he knew what he was doing. Miles Morales, who's the main main character in the film, didn't appeal to me in any way. I didn't even know about Miles Morales before I watched the film. For most of the film, Miles plays the role of comedic relief, and only at the very end does he get to do anything heroic by himself. There's also the fact that Into The Spider-Verse is a very kinetic film, in which almost everything happens fast. Therefore, it has to be seen more than once in order for the viewer to understand and to notice everything that happens in it. So, not only was seeing Into The Spider-Verse for the first time a new and somewhat odd experience for me, I didn't really find any of the main characters truly appealing. However, seeing Across The Spider-Verse in a theater made me like Into The Spider-Verse even more than I already did. First of all, both Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy get more character development in Across The Spider-Verse, thus turning them into more appealing characters. Second of all, many people (especially young men) have already been expressing their sweet hard love for Across The Spider-Verse, and especially for Gwen Stacy, on the internet. A few of them have been calling Across The Spider-Verse the best thing ever. Good for you, guys. But I don't share your euphoria. Perhaps it's because I'm a little more knowledgeable. Therefore, my reviews don't come down to phrases like ""Best movie ever!"" or ""F*ck this movie!"". Third of all, the animation style of Across The Spider-Verse is somewhat different from the animation style of Into The Spider-Verse. In some scenes, the animation of Into The Spider-Verse is almost photorealistic. But the animation of Across The Spider-Verse is often almost impressionistic. Both films feature some beautiful and detailed backgrounds. Fourth of all, I wouldn't go so far as to say that Across The Spider-Verse is a better film than Into The Spider-Verse. I think that they're equally impressive, though Across The Spider-Verse is perhaps a more exciting film. Fifth of all, all of the people in the auditorium where I got to see this animated film were adults. Most of them were in their late-twenties, thirties, or early-fourties. Some of them were old people. All of them were enjoying seeing the film a lot. What is going on here? I had a similar peculiar experience when I watched Titanic (1997) in a theater in February of this year. Most of the people in the auditorium were women, mostly young women, and some of them were truly excited and were even crying by the time the film came to an end. When the credits began to roll, these members of the fair sex all began to talk excitedly about the film. All I can say is that James Cameron knows how to make films that appeal to both men and women. No wonder his films bring in so much cash. Sixth of all, seeing Across The Spider-Verse later made me spend half a day on watching Into The Spider-Verse again on video. I watched some scenes several times, and I often paused the movie in order to look at the backgrounds and the character designs. It's true that Gwen Stacy sometimes moves like a ballet dancer in this film too. Before watching Across The Spider-Verse, I barely knew anything about Phil Lord and Christopher Miller because I had no interest in what these filmmakers have done. But, after taking a look at their filmography, it turned out that they worked on several films that I like quite a lot, and I got to see most of their films in theaters.",positive
1000,"For me, it flew by in an instant. I just want to express my gratitude to everyone who worked on this masterpiece. The animation that the music emphasizes makes you cry, because you can watch it. The best I've seen in the last few years, I'm waiting for the 3rd part of this masterpiece.Spider-Man: The Web of Universes' is a rich dramatic intensity with a luxurious wrapper. That strong moment when the obvious villain can be pushed back to devote more time to the interpersonal conflict of the protagonist. Everything is not so simple there, and for greater effect, the authors superbly wind up and wind up so that the expected explosion of feelings, thoughts, words occurs in time. When it seems that there is more comedy in the cartoon, and like you shouldn't hope for something serious, the script hits confidently and intelligibly that there are topics for thoughtful conversations. In general, if you want a true comic, then this is it! No agenda, away from social realism, solving the problems of the multiverse, cheerful fan service, professional approach. Everyone is happy. Summer has begun.",positive
